I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US ON THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH .
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT , IN SOME CASES , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
Also , I want to say that the plays and films were excellent , but there were n't enough of them for me .
In our Academy we are not allowed to smoke .
I was truly disappointed by it .
Secondly , I had to wait forty - five minutes before the show finally began .
I 'd like you to send the money to this address : ul Taklowa 10
It is a dream come true and was really unexpected for me !
If not , what do you suggest ?
The festival was excellent in many ways , and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging , but brilliant idea .
MY NAME is JAMES CAMIREZ AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY STATES THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30 , AND I GOT REALLY MAD WHEN I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND NOTICED THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 ( FORTY ) MINUTES AND THE SHOW HADN'T STARTED YET ... I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING !
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT . HOW CAN THIS CLASS OF THEATRE BE SO ..
OH I'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ONE LAST THING , IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER HAD SO I DEMAND MY MONEY BACK !
MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ME IN SEVERAL WAYS . I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ; THE MORE COMFORTCOMFORTABLE WE GET .
BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PASSIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE .
THIS CAN BE BAD TOO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BEING COMFORTABLE , WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORK I WON'T BE ABLE TO .
Everybody attented go to the show , funny , and happy in the end , and what have we go then ?
Disappointed !
If you could not manage the programme , why did n't you inform people before the programme started ?
I thought you understood ' ; please send money back to me , you know why , do n't answer me ?
Now we know , our world has developed to new world , because we have high technology to do .
Today , technology is a part of life .
It started from got up in the morning , we have the machine help us to cook , iron , cleaning , washing , and then we went out to work , there are car , sky train to travel for help us convenience and quickly .
We appreciated the modern technology changed my daily life for help every easy and quickly , we have time to do many things .
It is a good start to go on a sightseeing bus on Monday morning , because we can see all the famous buildings in a few hours .
On Wednesday after we have visited the National Art Gallery , we can have a chat about our next holiday during the free time in the afternoon .
Nowadays the main attraction in the newspapers and on television is the private lives of famous people .
On the whole , being rich and famous does n't always bring happiness , whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous .
Last week we had another demonstration of this .
Firstly , it will introduce the latest fashions connecting Millennium .
Whenever I recollect it , I feel self - confident .
Firstly , I would like to say that I 'm very glad to have been chosen and I will do my best for this competition .
As you mentioned about the accommodation , I would prefer to stay in a tent , because it 's more exciting and I really love camping .
However , I would choose sailing because I am fascinated with the sea and its mysteries and I also like the water , the wind in my face ...
The other one I would choose is basketball because I 'm tall and very fast with the ball .
It was unbelievable ! ! !
Are you studying a lot ?
I have just received your letter which made me so happy . I can not believe that I won first prize in your competition , because I have always believed I am an unlucky man and now I think some things are changing in my life .
I would definitely choose basketball and swimming which are my dream sports .
I would like to ask a few things , especially about the weather : what is the weather like in July in the U.S.A ? What kind of clothes will I need and how much money should I take with me ? Because I have never been to the U.S.A. before I do n't know anything about it .
I have never enjoyed doing shopping , but nowadays there are some people who are called shopaholics .
They are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because they can not stop themselves unless they have not got money to spend .
Because nowadays wherever you go there is a big queue and I hate waiting .
The queues are not the only problem . If you go by car there is the problem of parking , if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during your journey and you wo n't always be lucky enough to find a seat .
Especially if you want to buy clothes with your girlfriend or if you are a girl , you have to be ready to spend hours trying on clothes .
I really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they go into a shop they want to try on every single item of clothing and they do not realise the time .
Some people say " shopping is not always enjoyable " but for me it is definitely unenjoyable and I think it will be the same for the rest of my life .
First of all , when I bought the tickets it appeared that there was no discount available .
It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was staring at us .
Firstly when I went to the show it was written that the start time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight . I had waited for forty - five minutes .
I just knew I should n't have trusted her but as I went in the house my dad asked Pat to stay for a meal . I was in shock , thinking why is n't anyone getting angry with me ? After a while we sat down for dinner and Pat just told my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry .
As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland , we appreciate spending a week in London every year .
First , we could n't get a discount , although you mention it in your advertisement .
I walked back , hoping I would n't come across anyone and be able to drive back home .
Firstly , could you invite stars and artists from more than only six countries ?
In my opinion , it might be better to have time with a variety of nationalities .
As they know about your interests and personality , it is easy to help you .
I would like to make some comments about the event that I went to .
- Art exhibitions to teach us more things about the artist 's lifestyle ; and
Well , about rules in my country , the situation is not different from other countries .
The rules must be respected by all people if you do n't want to be kicked out of school .
However , some of them have read an advertisement about the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March .
Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depressed : in fact , money and celebrity do n't always bring happiness .
In addition , admission for students is free .
Yours sincerely ,
On the other hand , the bond between parents and children is unlikely to change .
The smokers in the school yard , the buffet and the other pupils , who are sitting at their tables doing their homework .
That 's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to avoid boredom . I am sure that eventually we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free . There wo n't be any problem with being up - do - date .
Of course , you ca n't afford a luxury car and a large apartment unless you 're born with a silver spoon in your mouth .
It 's also a really popular job among university students because of the good salary .
I was really surprised when I opened it .
I look forward to going to the Camp California in the USA .
Because it reminds me of my childhood . I used to go with my friends to a camp , which was situated by the seaside .
Nowadays we have many big shopping centres .
The most suitable time for shopping is the weekend when parents do n't work and children haven't got school .
Because of that , shopping centres are overcrowded .
You ca n't buy something in a peaceful and calm atmosphere .
However such centres are very useful and necessary .
In my opinion the worst thing which may happen is an extremely long queue for the changing room .
If you bought something gorgeous , you will be very happy .
Yours sincerely
I 'm writing to you because of the musical show " Over the rainbow " , which I saw on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre .
There are several points I have to complain about which meant the evening was not nice at all .
Instead of half past seven the show started at quarter past eight . I could n't go to get any refreshment for two reasons , the first one is that there was no information about how long the start of the show was going to be late by .
On your tickets information is written that discounts are available , when I asked at the ticket office I could n't get any discount for being a student .
After one hour the whole class had heard about Sarah 's secret .
Everybody was interested in what she had won but nobody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told as a secret to them .
Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class , when she turned around talking and whispering started .
Sarah looked at him for a while , then she stood in front of the class and explained to the others that she had won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the coast of southern France and every one of the 19 pupils was invited , except Pat who was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I read your advertisement five days before , and I was really impressed by it .
But , the quality of this show was n't what you led me to believe it would be , and I feel really disappointed by it .
For all these reasons , and if you want to keep me as a customer , I would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back .
My marks were n't good enough to obtain my degree in Computer Science , and the exam session was finished .
I never talked about this project to anyone , except my best friend Pat .
It is a great opportunity because this show is only every two years and normally it is difficult to go in .
Or going to the show on Wednesday morning and in the afternoon , we can choose between free time or the National Art Gallery .
I look forward to hearing from you .
They found him two months later and six months later he was in jail .
I am writing this letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show " over the rainbow " , which is misleading in a number of ways .
Sweating and afraid I waited outside the director 's office the following day .
Tears ran down my face as I admitted having stolen .
I was surprised that my father did n't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me .
That evening my father said a few words : ' May this be the end of your career as a thief ; we are only ready to forgive if you promise never to start again '
I am writing to reply to your letter in which you told me I won first prize in your competition , which is two weeks . I was very happy with this result since I did not think I could win .
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities in our daily life at school should be filmed to give the other students an idea of what we usually do , not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time .
The purpose of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical " Over the Rainbow " , which really disappointed me .
First of all , there were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so I had to pay the original price which was n't cheap at all .
Then , I was forced to wait forty - five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 instead of 19:30 and , when it finally started , I was really disappointed to see that the actors were n't Danny and Tina as it had said in the advertisement .
Your really dissatisfied customer
How has modern technology affected my daily life ?
We live surrounded by inventions which help as through the day .
The reason for my decision is that other activities are also available in my country , except climbing , but I have a fear of heights so this one is not destined for people like me .
Actually , they put me very close to the stage , in the middle of the real hell .
This is the main reason why I want to ask for a refund .
People wo n't be embarrassed to show the beauty of their bodies .
Moreover , I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine .
During my stay at Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practise this activity regularly and I often enter competitions : this is one of my hobbies .
Then , there was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights ; it was just enough time .
We would suggest going to this fabulous show .
Yours sincerely ,
Despite being used in many ways , it could entertain us as well .
Although I imagine them in my house in my future , I am sure I would be surprised if I had them .
A useful helper : the personal computer can quickly help you in lots of situations .
Although the world of computers will develop day by day , I lively hope we ( human beings ) can maintain our way of seeing things .
I'M VERY PROUD TO BE THE WINNER OF YOUR COMPETITION ! I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SUCH A CAMP BEFORE AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SPENDING TWO WEEKS THERE .
IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR ME TO TRAVEL IN JULY BECAUSE OF MY IRREGULAR WORK .
HE 'S A SMALL ONE !
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU
YOU KNOW THAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO HELP AT A CONCERT . TO BE PART OF THE STAFF WOULD BE WONDERFUL , I THOUGHT . AND I WAS RIGHT !
AS YOU KNOW I WROTE TO THAT ORGANISATION WHICH IS ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR BIG EVENTS .
ALL OF THE STAFF AND THE ORGANISATION SPOKE ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW TO SAVE PEOPLE .
WE WERE A GROUP ! ONE TEAM ! BEFORE THE CONCERT WE HAD A BREAK TO EAT SOMETHING AND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER .
THE CONCERT WAS VERY LOUD AND LONG BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK HARD .
GREETINGS AND HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON
However , it was a very disappointing evening for me .
Firstly , it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but , in fact , only one actor was performing in the show .
Thirdly , the advertisement said that discounts were available but the ticket seller said that there was no discount allowing or available .
In addition , the advertisement mentioned that the restaurant would be open after the show but it was closed because short of cooker .
Finally , I would like to ask for my money back on the ticket due to the disappointing evening out and the misleading advertisement you have created .
Nowadays , modern technology is becoming absolutely essential to our daily life .
Without all this your life would definitely change back to the same position as it were 50 or more years ago .
If this continues to happen our life will be very miserable as accidents happen all the time .
Thank you very much for the many interesting positions in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are sure , will be very exciting .
I would like to inform you that we have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " and we have found it very interesting .
Suddenly I heard a noise from my garden and I wanted to know what it was , but it was impossible to do it .
I was afraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get into my house .
I was very frightened , but I knew that I had to do something .
I was sure there was someone on the other side of the wall .
The only thing which really disappointed me was a visit to your theatre where I wanted to see the musical ' over the rainbow ' , after I read the advertisement for the show .
The things that really disappointed me were that you said Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were the actors but they were n't , different actors played and to be honest they made the whole show very bad .
To be honest that was not a great experience and I hope you will see my point .
Since everyone can afford modern technology everyone 's life in the more developed countries has changed completely .
So in the last century our daily life has changed dramatically and we have become lazy and our life impersonal , fast and unromantic .
Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another , unknown actor who starred instead of him .
All those inaccuracies spoilt what should have been a memorable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket .
He did it some more times , and in the end nobody took any notice of the shouts .
You are working with your ideal woman , I still ca n't believe that I spoke with her .
At first I could n't believe that I was a winner
My school starts in September and it finishes in June .
If I could go in July that would be grate .
I would like to ask you , what sort of clothes should I take with me ? I do n't want to take too much ; jeans , jumper , swimming costume , T - shirt , sports shoes I think should be O.K.
At first I was helping to sell the tickets - it was n't difficult .
We had to check every plug , switch , light .
I could n't believe how big a lamp can be .
Fortunately nothing had happened .
Only people who were helping and organizing this concert could meet her .
Some of them were speaking with her , I was n't this lucky person , but still I 'm happy , that I could be there .
Log cabins may be more comfortable . On the other hand I think that I will be able to " survive " in a tent .
I wish you had been here with me .
You can not imagine how disappointed I was with myself .
We started to put everything on the stage and after this we realized that the band was coming onto the stage near us .
After all of this we saw the show from the best place , near the stage and afterwards , the thing that I most liked , we were invited to see the group and got their signatures .
I have got a few things to complain about regarding your theatre .
I decided to go and visit your theatre restaurant .
For example , once people had to walk from one place to another , but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol - powered vehicles and we can travel faster with them .
We can also use technology to produce more food and help them grow faster .
The rules at home are very different . I am allowed to do what I want as long as I study enough to aprove .
It is not always easy , but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them .
I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesitate to contact me .
In addition to this , you may have some robots bringing the newspaper to the table , tidying up the house , and doing the shopping . Maybe they will also be your life partners .
I and my friend Emma helped to paint the scenery on the stage .
As you know , I like drawing and painting when I have some free time so that is why I chose to paint the scenery .
Moreover , the restaurant was still under construction so that we could n't use it when we were extremely hungry .
One of the biggest things that have changed is the change in the methods of communication .
I have mentioned a few changes above but there 's still the biggest one left , which is related to the field of computers .
I refer to your advertisement in the Herald Tribune where you advertised the Circle Theatre and the recent musical :
When we arrived at the theatre we realised that there were no discount tickets available as were mentioned in your advertisement so we had to buy the most expensive ones .
I am looking forward to your prompt reply .
Today the fashion industry has a great importance in the commercial market .
There are the natural materials on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produces more and more synthetic materials , which relay on the production cost .
In 100 years most clothes will be made from synthetic material .
The contrast will be especially attractive .
Furthermore the style of the clothes is going to be more crazy and individual but there will still be numerous clothes for conservative people .
On balance fashion in 100 years time will be comfortable and colourful .
There will be clothes for everyone 's taste .
Our school is really very disciplined , especially about our clothes and behaviour .
When I read the advertisement , it said that the restaurant would be open .
On behalf of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised , especially the idea of visiting a gallery .
I grew up through the water world and I could n't live without it .
I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp . By the way , my team and I won the last school championship . I play guard on my team . I also like tennis but I am not very good . I was wondering if you could give me some lessons while I am there .
I do not have words to express how happy I am . I would like to thank you and Camp California for this opportunity .
Since man became man he has needed to hunt to survive . In ancient times he used spears , bows and arrows , and the woman 's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff .
Nowadays , in the year 2000 we still practise this ancient art but in a different way , we do n't use weapons for hunting animals in the jungle , we use the remote to hunt TV shows , and we do not collect vegetables any more , we go shopping .
This activity of shopping has become one of our most important , after all , we go shopping for any reason , we have developed such an instinct for shopping that we can proudly say that we are some sort of kings of the urban jungle .
If an activity has stayed with us , mankind , for so long , it must give us some pleasure and maybe that 's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price marked on it , that is the greatest of ecstasies .
But where is the bad part of it ? Well shopping can became horrible at Christmas for example , when hundreds of people go to the shopping centre and it also can cause many problems when you become an impulsive buyer .
Shopping is not always enjoyable because of several factors .
One could be when you go into a shop and you find something that you like , and you decide to buy it , but when you see the price , you find out that it 's too expensive , and you can not afford to buy it .
This situation is very annoying for most people , and that 's what makes shopping unenjoyable .
Why do n't we include some sports , for example , volleyball ?
Furthermore , it 's a worthwhile experience for people who want to know about other countries ' arts .
Finally , with regard to tickets , it is a really wonderful idea because it is more convenient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people .
One day , when the old man went into the bamboo bush , he found some bamboo gritted white .
He had never seen such bamboo before but decided to cut it down .
THE KIND OF ACCOMMODATION I PREFER IS A TENT BECAUSE AT SUMMER CAMP I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING SLEEPING OUTSIDE UNDER THE SKY WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE AND WARM .
I'M QUITE GOOD AT PLAYING BASKETBALL BECAUSE I USED TO PLAY FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AT SCHOOL . WE USED TO HAVE TRAINING SESSIONS TWICE A WEEK AND AT LEAST TWO GAMES A MONTH AGAINST ANOTHER SCHOOL , WHICH WAS GREAT .
PAINTING ALWAYS DID FASCINATE ME , EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT SO GOOD AT IT , BUT MY FRIENDS SAY I CAN REALLY PAINT AND THEY LOVE THE THINGS I DO . THE TECHNIQUE I LIKE THE MOST IS WATERCOLOURS .
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE HELPING AT THE POP CONCERT IN OUR TOWN ?
The reason I 'm writing this letter to you is that during my stay in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre .
After all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad . I think I can only forgive your theatre if you give me a refund of the money I spent there , and some more for all the problems I had .
As you already know , I am trying to become a professional photographer , consequently I would choose photography as the first activity and painting as the second .
However , I would like to know if by any chance the photography activities are only for beginners .
Actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently , the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful , or simply something they like , should be considered a very pleasant occasion .
In fact , the shopping you do for your daily needs is seldom enjoyable , as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and moreover you are often faced with some nasty situations .
First of all , when I paid my entrance fee they did n't accept my discount ticket , they told me that the ticket was fake , then I entered the theatre and I had to wait 45 minutes . The show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15 , " this shows a lack of respect " .
Manager , I expect that you have considered my bad experience at your theatre , so I 'm asking you for my money back , because it was a very bad evening .
It all started when Pat , Nick 's best friend , wanted to have the party at his house . Most of the class disagreed with that because the Pat 's house is extremely little , they started to say to him that his house was like a box .
Pat got very angry and sad .
At first Nick got angry but then he forgave him because they were friends and each of them could trust in the other .
Nick told the situation to the class and offered his house for the party , because it was very big , with large gardens and a big swimming pool .
To begin with the school rules , we have in fact some important ones .
Since I have studied photography for several years , I would like to take some pictures of beautiful scenery in California .
I had to pay the full price for them , which was quite expensive .
It turned out to be impossible : the restaurant was closed and we did n't even receive an explanation .
The development of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones , has greatly changed our way of life .
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and anytime , even if we are two thousand kilometres away from each other .
Precision industry has changed my life a lot too . I go Scuba Diving during the weekends and holidays .
I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in August .
How can shopping be enjoyable in this situation !
I believed everything she told me .
I was surprised that he believed me .
Yours sincerely ,
They are human beings and they need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people , to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses , hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognised .
Furthermore , you asked me to choose two activities I would like to do .
And now for them shopping can be considered like a contrariety .
It is quite obvious that celebrities ca n't lead a normal life , as they are constantly followed by reporters , which makes their life miserable .
I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is widely discussed in the mass - media .
Last of all , it says in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant open after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was being redecorated and no announcement was made .
Therefore I would like are refund of my ticket and I would like an apology .
Yours Sincerely ,
What do you think models will wear on the catwalks ?
In my opinion , clothes will be a lot different in 100 years ' time .
For the accommodation at Camp California , I would prefer to have a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent , and in case there is a big storm with heavy rain . A log cabin 's more resistant than a tent .
For the activities , I chose climbing because I took a course for 2 weeks last year and now I have a good level of proficiency . For the other one I chose photography but I am not a professional , I just take some pictures on my holiday !
Next weekend I have a date with one of them , but I wo n't tell you the name because you 'll feel jealous !
I would like to do photography and swimming .
I love to take photos but I do n't have any technique .
Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves , like clothes , jewellery , anything .
When you buy something you were looking for a long time and , when you arrive at home , you discover some defect on it and have to go back to the store to complain .
Secondly , I would like to choose a tent for accommodation , because I have never spent time in a tent , that 's why , I think it is a good opportunity for me .
I have plenty of experience and knowledge of both aspect of part .
I would be grateful if you could inform me .
My jobs were collecting tickets , selling goods and refreshments , guiding people to the right seat and cleaning up the concert hall after the concert finished .
What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achieved through our support .
I really recommend you to help them , I think this is a good opportunity and I want you to understand my feeling well .
I want to know your opinion .
On the other hand , their stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create their own story based on the true story just to get the people 's attention .
All of them were shocked by what they heard .
She became very shy and angry . She could n't talk with people and she was just very sad .
I want to tell you that I am very disappointed about the play .
In the advertisement it said that Danny Brook was in the starring role .
And also it should have started at 19.30 , as I saw in the advertisement , but it started at 20.15 !
And so far there were n't any discounts available which were said to be " available " in the advertisement .
You should have written it in the advertisement .
Absolutely it was very disappointing
I hope you understand and will correct your mistakes in the next advertisement and send me my money soon !
Today 5 out of every 10 pupils can use a computer basically .
It is really enjoyable when I chat with people .
Technology is also important in another area for me .
But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writing something on the board .
Unfortunately I have to complain about the musical show put on in your Circle Theatre last night .
When I received your advertisement concerning the show " Over the Rainbow " I thought that I 'd have a great evening , but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me .
First of all , Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was absent .
You also offered discounts - what kind of discounts ?
Because the show was very long , we were getting hungry but of course your theatre restaurant was closed because of the holiday .
I had not any money for travelling and my parents were going to give me some only if I had concrete plans .
After one month , I went back home and told my parents what a lot of fun I had with my friends - I do n't know why I was such a liar .
My parents believed my story until my younger brother Pat told them the truth .
Now my parents do n't believe my story .
I hope you will not feel offended , but I really need to complain about your theatre .
You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not performing and I was more bewildered that no one made an apology for it !
Although , I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket , as you mentioned in the advertisement , but unfortunately , these could n't possibly be given either !
If more and more engineers work in science and technology , it must be because it is really useful : but in what particular way ?
I would like to travel at the beginning of the month , which could be between the first and the fifteenth of July , because afterwards I have several business meetings and it would be difficult for me to take a trip .
Although I like camping and sharing with different kinds of people , I 'd prefer a comfortable and private place ( if it 's possible ) where I can sleep , or be quiet .. I am not a teenager !
I was running the whole show . My responsibility was to dress her .
I really liked the exhibitions .
The band " Three Kings " presented a new style of music .
I would like to notice that the dance show was absolutely marvellous .
What a great idea to invite writers ! I really liked talking with them .
You wrote an advertisement saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit this concert , but there were artists from only 6 countries .
It was really a pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy .
The International Arts Festival was organised quite well . I would only recommend you have more artists and the classical concert should be in a bigger hall .
They were so poor that sometimes they hardly had anything to eat .
She persuaded him to go to the sea to ask for a lot of things for her .
Also , the e - mail system is really helpful .
Circle Theatre
Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined , it was definitely not the " perfect evening " as written in the advertisement .
Synthetic materials have developed and become very popular so they would keep going .
I guess they will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt , or more masculine clothes because they want to change .
About the accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities .
In conclusion , like all things in life , shopping can be pleasant or irritating depending on your patience and on your mood that day .
It gives us knowledge useful for many school clubs , like the " marathon shell " club or the robotics club .
Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mechanical engineer and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mechanical engineer . It lets us identify our abilities and the part of mechanics that we prefer .
Our engineering school is specialised in mechanics and thermodynamics .
First , we could film the fluid mechanics lessons and the general mechanics lessons .
I wonder if we could not feet between some short view of the laboratories , in which we could show a student doing experiments .
Future students could appreciate coming if they could still do their sport .
Another point to record would be the time we have got between lessons or at lunch time . It will show a part of the way of life in the school .
If possible , the type of accommodation I prefer is a tent .
I will be very glad to participate in your camp !
Yours faithfully
The show 's date is very convenient - March 14 - , and it is on in the Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there .
Although this statement is absolutely true , it seems there is no way to stop public attention , so they will have to keep living with journalists .
My name is Marcia Fomalar , I am writing to let you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical at the London theatre .
I went to buy a ticket and as I like to enjoy the show near the stage I bought a £ 20 ticket but when I asked for a discount they told me , " I am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement . It will be impossible to give you a discount " .
At 19:15 I was very impatient , waiting for the show to begin , and a man announced that the show would start at 20:15 .
Finally the show started and to my surprise my favourite actor Danny Brooke had been replaced by another actor .
Pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined .
The other activity that I chose is painting . I am not as good as I want , nevertheless I think I can improve my skills during this course .
I would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so I can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing I need to know is the amount of money that I have to bring with me .
To make this report easier and faster , it was necessary to make a questionnaire which was given out in the school .
However , 15% thought that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important .
As you can see , my classmates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have .
A few weeks ago , my family and I had a holiday in London . The holiday was n't too good !
During the week we decided where we wanted to go . We all agreed to listen to music so then we decided to go to your musical show and listen to " Over the Rainbow " .
That evening we did n't want to have our supper before the show . Anyway I thought it would be too early to eat and also because the timetable or candidates you give me have say : " visit our theatre restaurant after the show " .
So we did , but unfortunately it was closed and I was so disappointed about it , not only because we had expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove to be the actor of starring .
We do n't expect much bad to happen on our holiday , but this was a perfect show as well , it was the worst show and theatre I have ever been to in my life .
sincerely Ki
To help us to live happily , scientists can easily predict the changes on earth , so that we can have time to prepare or defend ourselves from natural disasters .
Weapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight . In the Second World War so many Germans were killed . Also many people died in other regions ,
Poisonous chemical compounds , e.g. gases and liquids , are created too . They have been used to kill people . Most of them produce radiation , which can disable a person , mostly harming their brain and their bodies , and it can also cause death .
Communication technology , e.g. internet ( networks ) and mobile phones .
In wars soilors communicate with mobile phones though places to place to get or give information about themselves and the enemy .
By using the Internet we can make new pen friends overseas , and create clubs and societies .
Now a message can travel quicker and it is also worldwide . sending letters takes about a week from Hong Kong to the U.K. , but network , e.g.
Modern technology saves us a lot of time and brings us many benefits when we use it in the right way , but some bad way to e.g. send virus to break down network .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party was n't as successful as we thought .
We decided to go to his place ( I 've got a copy of the key ) the evening before his birthday while he was at work and decorate the lounge , then turn off the lights and wait for him in silence until he arrived .
With reference to our trip to London , on behalf of all of us , the English class in this college , we would like to thank you for your special attention in organising a good programme to learn about the interesting and cultural places in London .
We have been very excited about this and coincidentally we have found another option to add to our programme , certainly if you agree with it .
We thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformations nowadays in England concerning fashion , leisure , sports and lifestyle .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
I was at home putting my makeup on before going to a restaurant with my friends and , suddenly , he rang the bell . He was so tense with a gun in his hands and I could no longer speak . He took me out with him .
I had tried to think about stopping him , but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he forced me to buy cocaine using my cheques .
I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , of which you are the manager .
Although it was written in the show 's advertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook , it , unfortunately , was not him .
It was also written in the show 's advertisement that there would be discounts available on the tickets .
Even though the advertisement said we should visit it after the show , it was closed and no explanations were given .
In conclusion , the advertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out , but it was not , so I would like to ask for my money back .
One day , I innocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe , the school 's hunk and most popular boy .
Suddenly , an enormous sadness caught me , because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone , so he would definitely break up with me , and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat , because she had just ruined my happiness and I could n't trust her anymore .
One day , while I was studying maths , one of my friends , called Pat , asked me to have a coffee with her .
The problem started when I confessed to her that I had fallen in love with Larry , who was my cousin 's boyfriend .
Surprisingly there was a completely different actor starring .
Unfortunately the restaurant was closed .
He is only looking for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccessful for 86 days .
Little by little we were growing up and becoming close friends .
I relied on her and our relationship was excellent .
It is my only favourite hobby .
To reply to your question , it was really a nice experience .
As you know , I like pop music so much and the singer was one of my favourite singers .
I would be most grateful if you could let me have some information :
- Are there leisure and entertainment facilities close to the camp ?
I am really surprised for the information because I won , and I would like to say thank you for everything . This is why I wrote and sent this letter with the information you need I can only travel in July because it is the only time when I can do it before for my work I do not really care what accommodation I will have . I would prefer to come in July I will be available for the moment . I would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at Camp California I choose the Golf and Photography because I think I am really interested in those subjects . I am not really really good but I have some experience .
I think that is everything I would like to know .
I want to apologise to you , because I haven't written to you recently , but I want to tell you what happened to me last week . I had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city . So imagine , I felt really really good and excited . I do n't have words to describe it but I will try to do it , OK ?
What 's more , your letter said about the chance to do two activities during the camp .
I have even won a competition once .
I would like to know if the , , travel costs '' which you had paid include entrance tickets to the museums or any other cultural places , because I would like to do some sightseeing in the U.S.A. Furthermore , if there will be cmy tumble dryer or washing machine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp .
When describing the advantages , we should remember that most people like doing shopping .
Very often people go to a shop - usually a big department store and buy things which they do not need .
From my point of view it depends on us whether shopping will be enjoyable or not .
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show Over the Rainbow , which took place in your establishment , The Circle Theatre , which made me feel very upset .
I was very excited to see it yesterday , but as soon as I arrived at the theatre the problems began .
Yours sincerely ,
Firstly , the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade , with the development of telephones , radio stations , television and even satellites , and of course , the Internet , gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world , and this allowed health and education research to increase as well .
In addition to that , people will always be afraid of a technological war .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people must learn that despite technology being such a new area to explore , we have to use it with a great deal of responsibility for us all to survive in the future .
And is there anything else I have to take with me ?
Yes , it is true . This is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before , and some women do n't earn money . They have no idea how difficult it is to earn money .
It would be wonderful to buy some books or programmes with the signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival .
I hope this letter will help you with organizing the festival .
Every pupil has to sit alone . ( I mean that one desk is given to one person . )
2 . One should have such marks as , , 3 " , , , 4 " , , , 5 " , not , , 2 " , which is equal to fail .
We do n't have old - fashioned rules or anything like that .
First of all , it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest month in the year , and the weather will be really nice .
Despite my lack of experience in climbing I do want to try this type of sport .
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed .
I have interviewed each student from my English class .
Firstly , the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving their knowledge .
It contributes to the world 's treasure house of literature and arouses an irresistible fascination .
We should n't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college , especially if we take into consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespeare .
Also , painting is one of my favourite things !
Anyway , I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month so that I 'd like to write about it !
Anyway , by the time we finished everything , thousands of fans came into this concert hall .
I 'm writing to you with reference to the letter I have received from you saying I have won your competition .
Well , as you ask , I will tell you I would like to travel as soon as July begins , I 'm going to be able only to travel in that month because of my job responsibilities .
Regarding the choice of tents or log cabins , I think I will turn to the first one because I have always loved camping close to nature , if possible , in front of a lake or a river , if your campsite has one , so that I will be able to do my favourite and skillful hobby : sailing .
I would like to travel only in July , because I have only one month 's holiday this year .
It is not too comfortable , but that is not a problem for me . I like this kind of holiday .
I never had met pop stars before and I was very impressed , but I was too happy to show my shyness .
I stayed with him until the concert began and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dancers .
So , unfortunately , I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had , and having given the reasons , I expect to be able to count on your sense of responsibility , so , I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds I spent on that terrible night .
Also , with today 's machines , factories have significantly increased their production , which brings progress to humanity , but also , with the continuous replacement of men by machines , unemployment is increasing too , and today , it worries every single citizen of the world , specially the ones who live in third world countries .
It would be a fun experience !
Women , in particular , have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see .
This was the best thing that had ever happened to the Fennall family for yeats .
Which was very shocking for her mother .
SINCE I HAVE A CHOICE OF ACCOMMODATION , I'LL DEFINITELY GO FOR THE LOG CABIN , BECAUSE I CAN'T BEAR THE HEAT INSIDE A TENT .
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE WEATHER CONDITIONS , SO I CAN DECIDE ON WHAT CLOTHES TO TAKE , AND ABOUT COSTS , SO I CAN MAKE A BUDGET FOR THE HOLIDAY .
AFTER THE STAGE WAS BUILT , THE REST OF THE THINGS I HAD TO DO WERE QUITE EASY AND ENJOYABLE ; I COULD STAY EITHER BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF THE STAGE AND GIVE A HAND IF NEEDED . I REALLY ENJOYED IT BECAUSE I LEARNT A LOT OF TECHNICAL THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW ; AND WHAT I ALSO ENJOYED WAS THE GOOD PAY !
I 'm writing to you to complain about a play I have seen , called : " Over the rainbow " .
It was clear that Pat had to change and show his friends that they could believe in him thoroughly .
For those next few days , Pat would do his best to be as sympathetic as possible .
To begin with , every morning Pat said a pleasant " hello " and added to that a big smile .
His mother always says : " If you are smiling and are nice to people , people will be nice and will smile at you " .
I would prefer to travel in July . I have only this time , because my summer holidays are during these days .
A cabin reminds me too much of my home and is too comfortable . That is n't what I want to have if I stay in a wild area .
I was able to ask anybody , and he answered in detail , although he had a lot of work .
I 'm writing to you following our visit to your theatre last night .
And I would like to know if it is possible to have our money back .
And if someone else knew , I would n't be able to go back to heaven unless I killed the person who told my secret .
And I would like to go in the first part of this month , the second part I spend with my family .
While I will be at the Camp I would like sailing , because it is my favourite sport .
Yours faithfully
In my opinion this book ' The Old Man and the sea ' is the best book which Ernest Hemingway wrote .
Thise book is about a man who knows that he will die soon , he knows that he did n't make his dream come true .
So he decided to go for a last trip in his life .
He needs to rest , but he does n't give up .
In the end he makes his dreams come true , he catches a vast Marlin .
In this book Hemingway is trying to tell us , that if we want something , we can get it , it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it .
Sometimes they give up , before they get something ,
I read the advertisement and I thought it was going to be a pleasant evening .
From the beginning it was all a disappointment .
When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with my student card , but that was not possible .
I let this pass and I bought it anyway , thinking that it was possible that this was only a mistake in your advertisement .
But the play started forty - five minutes late , and the star of the show , of whom I 'm a great fan an who was the main reason for why I decided to see the play , had been changed for another actor , who turned out to be really bad .
I think you realise why I 'm writing this letter to ask you to give me my money back .
All the things that were promised in your advertisement were untrue , and it was definitely NOT the perfect evening out .
Expecting that you will resolve this misunderstanding .
There 's no doubt that modern technology has changed our lives , but how ?
I think that some of the changes have been very good , like the improvement in medical science , which now can save millions of people that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives .
It has changed the ways people communicate .
But technology has not only changed our lives in a good way , giving us things that can make our lives more comfortable , it has also created things that are n't bad , but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the world .
Weapons and factories are destroying our planet and we need to realise that we have to use technology to improve our lives , while always trying to respect nature .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins because I have a lot of experience of putting up my own tents .
I like to go window shopping that is good to go around the shopping centre .
Then I can say I definitely do n't feel it is enjoyable .
- Accommodation : a log cabin would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California .
Before we can give our opinions on this statement we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing .
We do not speak here about luxury goods .
But if you realize how important what you buy is for your health you will go shopping with a far greater consciousness and more joy than before . '
How incredible it is !
I love swimming and also I 've got a scuba diving licence .
I used to enjoy floating on the water whenever I was on holiday .
Singing is the most favourite hobby for us .
I 'd like to know how much money , and how many clothes we need .
Of course , the shopkeepers are human beings as well .
But for their considerations , they 're working in their routines .
I sometimes lose my desire to buy a thing because of their bad behaviour .
For example , for our jobs , special ceremonies , and so on .
Your advertisement also failed to mention the fact that there were no discounts whatsoever and , finally , because of a shortage of staff , your restaurant was not open .
I asked myself how I could be so stupid , telling her my secret after all I had been going through to keep it to myself .
Now I did n't need to go around worrying about it anymore .
I decided to thank Pat , and maybe , if possible , teach her a lesson .
I pretended to be totally miserable .
Pat did n't know what to do . She apologised over and over again and I could really see that she was more than devastated .
After hugging each other we promised never to tell others about our secrets .
However , it was delayed and it started at 20.15 .
The theatre restaurant was closed after the show , they said funds had run out .
Those are totally unacceptable so I would like to get paid for my ticket cost .
I ask you to transfer money into this account .
Think about the computer , the speed of computers is much faster than before .
Nowadays , technology keeps developing and better technology gives us an easier life .
In the hope that you understand me .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
At first , when he had a girlfriend , they talked to each other frankly .
But after they separated , he told his friends her secrets without thinking .
It is like one of his bad habits .
It was a very unpleasant evening .
The restaurant should have been open when I came out , but it was closed because of the time the show finished .
After breakfast I have to use my car to get to school .
Without technology I would get really bored .
I would be very grateful to receive answers to my questions .
Boy , he 's really really handsome !
Secondly , the show was meant to begin at 19.30 pm , actually it began at 20.15 pm and that was without giving any explanation !
Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobile phone .
Sometimes the ring is annoying but , finally , the mobile phone is a great , handy object .
About the accommodation , from the two options , I choose to sleep in a tent , because I think that a log cabin is n't as authentic as a tent , at the camp .
I would be grateful if you could send me further information about details like how much money or what kind of clothes I 'll have to take with me .
You know that I 'm a little bit lazy , but the main reason for not writing to you has been the accumulation of exams during this month .
There I was impressed by how a singer can cause such hysteria in teenagers .
During the two - hour concert we had to attend to thirty - six people who became unconscious after being trapped in the first row by the other people .
Answering the second question , I would prefer my accommodation to be in log cabins .
And when it finally started , it was n't Danny Brook who performed .
After the show I wanted to drink something in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started too late !
So I ask you sincerely for my money back because it was n't a perfect evening out .
I told her that my parents are getting divorced and that I will move to Chicago with my mother .
One day , Pat and I were going home , when she asked me if I would give a party before I go .
I had to tell her that I did n't have the time to organise anything because we , my mother and I , had to get our stuff ready to move .
But when we got into the house there were all my friends !
We had a great evening because Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets !
I am writing to give the information you asked me for and also I would like to request some information about the prize .
Furthermore I would like to choose to stay in a tent instead of a cabin because I think it could be more exciting and could provide more contact with the environment .
He had a puncture and he did n't know how to repair it . Then I changed the tyre and during this time he was asking me about my hobbies , studies , everything .
I am writing to you in order to give you some details you asked me for in your letter .
The job was hard , but , from my point of view , it was worthwhile .
The most exciting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert , and we went to the Highlands to spend the whole day there .
That was fantastic !
If you have never been there , I really recommend you to go .
But we decided to buy a picture , because she had always told us about art galleries with great excitement .
Yours sincerely
Despite the fact that going to school by bus was easier than going by bicycle , I had preferred going to school by bicycle to going by bus .
When I went to see her play , I really would love to be an actress .
It was my dream . I wish my daddy
Especially in the summer when the temperature and humidity are very high .
From the list of all the activities I have chosen photography and golf .
I have chosen golf because I have never played this game .
My friend offered me a job as a member of the technical staff at Sting 's concert .
We 've built it using ready metal and wooden parts .
I was working with a specialist who had to connect all the lights together to one computer and prepare a colourful show .
It was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure working with professionals .
For me - the dance shows were absolutely wonderful .
I prefer them to others .
We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably priced ticket for all the events because we could change our plans during the event .
Most students wear jeans and a sweater .
Next year , you should calculate or examine how many people will come before you choose a hall , which I feel very good was plays and films .
And the offer of a " weekend ticket " was an excellent idea .
Because the price was cheaper than buying it separately and more convenient .
Yours Sincerely ,
Finally , food shops should be added to this festival next year because only plays and films were not attractive enough to get audiences .
Yours sincerely ,
However , I can go out whenever I want , even at midnight .
Secondly , boys are not allowed to have long hair .
I feel that they would be fabulous places with a western design .
Another disadvantage of the festival 's programme was the lack of plays and films which are the best to display a modern country 's culture , I think .
In conclusion , I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be made .
Fortunately , there are many ways to earn some money nowadays .
In addition to baby - sitting , you may also give some lessons to small children such as ( tl ) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language , English , for example .
But if you do n't like children and are not easy - going enough to work as a waiter you may choose the more peaceful job of a typist at home .
So , you can help them and earn quite enough .
Moreover , men prefer to do sports , because shopping wastes a lot of time , which is contrary to the tastes of women , because if they have any free time , they will go shopping .
Finally , I would be interested in meeting artists from everywhere in the world not only European artists .
In conclusion , I had an unforgettable time .
The restaurant was closed because there was n't any electricity . You should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used .
I was totally unsatisfied with the theatre and I would like to have my money back if that 's possible .
I 'm quite sure that people all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people , especially women , who like to be very elegant and beautiful , will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that 's it .
You ca n't be careful because you do n't know what time it will happen .
But you can be careful when you speak with he or she who is stealing your things .
I am writing this as a reply to your request to provide you with some information about my preferences .
I am not so keen about the accommodation but would rather stay in tents than cabins .
We live near the seashore and swimming is the sports activity I am really good at .
Sometimes I feel very sorry for her .
Lots of families plan a day out to go to a shopping centre , and it is a normal routine for them - to spend all day just shopping .
I would like the trip to start in July if possible . Because this is my holiday start at the Camp California , I would like my accommodation in a tent , because I work in the Army and on the camp I usually stay in a tent at night , so I will feel more comfortable .
Regarding the activities I would like to choose Swimming and climbing for my activities at the camp ; I usually do these two activities on the Army Camp . I know how to climb up on Rachiat outside and help other people to climb up .
To make a daily life video in school , we should concentrate on the things we do most in a school . The thing we do most in a school is have lessons . It will be a very useful part of this video and should be the main subject .
At the end of the video , we should find one or two students sit together and ask them a few questions about how they feel about studying at the school ? This is the suggestion to making a daily life video in school .
It would be great .
And we could n't wear any colourful clothes and socks .
I 'm persuading my mum , perhaps .
I am writing in response to your advertisement in today 's newspaper .
In addition to this , I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in the summer .
Unfortunately , Daniela fainted .
This story happened a long time ago .
Now Pat realized what was going on and could understand why her boyfriend got so nervous about the secret .
Nevertheless , I lost my concentration on my studies and I spent the money on entertainment .
I will never ever help anybody to organise a pop concert again .
But after this servile work I met Eminem .
As regards painting , I know a lot about it since my grandmother taught me when I was five years old .
She also told me that she has some connections with the people in charge of the lights at the concert .
Since I am going to travel I would like to know how much money it would be advisable to take and what kind of clothing I should take .
Or approximately how much money would be enough to buy souvenirs because this will be the first time for me visiting California .
Finally , I must choose travelling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work .
However , things which you can get with money do not necessarily fill your dissatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more , your emptiness might be greater .
And shopping is also a difficult hobby to go along with your friends or your partners .
On the whole , shopping can be harmful rather than enjoyable because you might be extravagant , lose your friends and have what you do n't need .
We think we could change the shopping to go to the show .
To sum up , there is no perfect job , and being famous involves a lot of money , but also a lot of journalists following your private life .
All the group would enjoy going to the show , because it is a great opportunity to see an exhibition of the latest fashions .
For example , we ca n't go to the toilet during lessons . We have to go there in the break .
It 's too strict . I do n't like it .
My name is Sandre Atos , I am writing to you because last weekend I went to the theatre you manage , to see what was called " London 's newest and best musical show " .
That 's why I am writing to ask for some money back ; I believe I have this right .
Unfortunately my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us .
On the other hand , due to scientific developments , I am getting better , recovering from asthma .
I had a very disappointing evening last Saturday .
I had everything planned ; my family and I were coming to watch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disastrous .
Then everything was going well until the show did n't start !
That was a disappointment for my whole family . In fact all the audience were very disappointed .
Anyway the show was nowhere near as good as it was meant to be and it was definitely worse than I had expected it to be . I did n't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress .
So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes , desperately searching for your restaurant , our stomachs rumbling for food .
What kind of an organisation do you call this , sir / madam ?
You do n't understand how disappointed and angry I was that night .
In fact he was one of the principal busybodies of his neighbourhood and his school so not a lot of people in his school liked him .
Some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously , maybe just a bit too seriously . They gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends , and started picking on younger people , or members of other gangs , trying to start fights with them .
This went on and on , got more and more serious , but it was so secret that the teachers did n't notice .
Everyone in the year was annoyed , but not with Pat , oh , no !
except a few psycho groups . Some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party , just for the fun and meanness of it .
Everyone was enjoying themselves except Pat , who had heard about the raid .
The time had come . The who groups had combined their forces and were ready to strike .
Lots of People were injured and even more were suspended the next day at school , when the Headmaster found out what had happened .
Pat received no punishment at all and he was n't blamed for anything by his teachers or friends .
But he felt awful because he knew that all this had happened because of him .
Do you like do - it - yourself and is your house full of marvellous but useless things ? You could sell them to a specialised shop and finally tidy up your room !
I am writing in response to the International Arts Festival , which took place on 21 - 22 November .
I would like to inform you that it was a great idea and a valuable activity as a social event .
However , it was a disappointment when I realised that not many countries were attending the event . I would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the world , for instance , the Far East , Indonesia etc .
On the other hand , I enjoyed being one of the people seeing the plays films , the dance shows which were brilliantly performed and the art exhibitions .
Finally , I appreciate your organisation and look forward to hearing about the next International Arts Festival .
What a pity !
Private schools have a more relaxed atmosphere than the state schools .
Of course smoking is n't allowed in any part of the school .
Apart from that I would n't mind at all whether I stay in tents or log cabins but if I have to choose between these two I 'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation . It is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping .
Photography is a very interesting activity , and is not too hard to do either .
Worst of all , at the end of the Musical , I went to your Theatre Restaurant , in order to have dinner , because I had left home without eating and so I was hungry at that time .
First of all , modern technology has changed my daily life in the last five years more quickly than in ancient times , or even than a decade ago .
Nowadays , I ca n't go one day without consulting computer communications via e - mail or the Internet . I exchange correspondence with all my family via the Internet , with my mother and 2 brothers who live in Curitilra City and also with a brother who lives in Italy and another who is living in New Zealand .
It 's written in the regulations that we ca n't leave the school during the breaks ; we ca n't smoke near the classrooms ; we have to justify our absences or lateness and even if you 're over eighteen your parents have to justify you with the teacher .
Regarding accommodation I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I enjoy the closeness to nature while camping a lot .
I sort of felt like I had done my part to make the concert a success .
The show is going to be on Tuesday the 14 of March from 10.00 to 19.00 and we find it very interesting , because we will have the opportunity to see mews , firstly about the latest fashions , secondly concerning leisure and sports wear and finally about make - up and hairstyles .
Thank you very much !
Most of the time they have journalists following them everywhere , looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper , and I do n't think this is very nice , but it is the price that famous people have to pay , just because they are popular .
Anyway , this is not always necessarily a problem , but it can be a big thing for the famous person , because it gets people talking about him and increases his popularity .
In conclusion , I can say that this is not the biggest problem that the world has and -- it is not my problem because I am not famous !
Coincidentally the show is in London and on Tuesday March 14 , which is during the period we are in London for the three - day programme .
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , because morality and principles are also concerned .
I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana dying in the car crash was one of the most disastrous examples .
Although we can not deny it is our nature - we are curious - we can improve our sense of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them .
Basle , 12th December 2000
In your letter , you asked me whether the book I 've read would be a suitable present for your cousin 's fifteenth birthday .
You wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic , detectives and sport , did n't you ? I think this is the best choice for him !
As you know , we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle , and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country !
Thank you for your letter , as usual , it 's a pleasure to receive news from you .
It 's a fantastic book , which I recommend to everybody keen on love stories .
It 's a perfect combination of passion and life 's difficulties .
I reckon that it 's not an easy read , but as you described your cousin , I think she really will enjoy it , she 's so good at literature that it wo n't be a problem for her .
I really think you should choose this one for her , it does go with her personality .
It 'll be a good point for her general education . Wuthering Heights is a classic , which everybody knows about , even if they haven't read it , they at least know the story .
How has modern technology changed my life ?
A computer is extremely helpful with writing reports and essays .
But also I am not able to imagine my life without this nice way of receiving news with help of it .
I would be very grateful if you could let us go to the show .
Furthermore , admission is free for students .
Unfortunately , our programme is fixed but I think we could change part of the programme .
Firstly , most people can remember the sad story of " Princess Diana " . She died in Paris a few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called " Paparazzi " .
However , secondly , famous people are not " alien " so they might do something , for example , shameful things in a public space , or argue with a partner or family , even put on a swimming costume like us .
So they can be just ordinary people like us .
Overall , people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people ... and then we can find the answer that all people , including famous people , need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life .
They were eager to have a child , but they had never been able to .
About when I would like to travel , I think that my answer will be easy for you , because I have two months off , those are July and August , so my trip should be in between . Regarding my accommodation I would like to stay in a tent because I remember my holidays in the south of Peru , a long time ago ; it was wonderful .
If it is possible for you to help me clear up some doubts I have , I 'll be really grateful .
Yours faithfully .
First of all , I 'll tell you that on the day of the concert I woke up at 6:30 a.m. , very early for me . You know me , I 'm lazy . The work began around 8:30 . It was very hard but then the band came to rehearse . From that moment I enjoyed working until the concert had finished . The atmosphere was wonderful , the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team .
Finally , we would like to get your permission to go . Maybe if it is possible that you can change your programme , we can go to your college any time after Tuesday .
This story happened two years ago .
Not only was I a member of the swimming team in our school , but also I had been taught by my father since I was five years old .
I started thinking about it . After all , either had I never done this task before , or trained .
It was really a reasonably priced weekend for me , but you should also introduce new activities like competitions in singing songs or drawing a portrait next year .
Secondly , the show should have started at 19:30 p.m. , and it began forty - five minutes late .
Moreover , when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were available .
Furthermore , I wanted to have a coffee after the show , but when I tried to get to the theatre restaurant , it was closed .
Balloons and coloured lights were put in all the trees .
I carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost their way .
As we are going to be in London on this date , we think it could be a great opportunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions , make up , etc . and it is free for students .
Because of this , we would kindly ask you to change the programme so that we could go to this particular event .
A special invitation
It allowed people to enjoy their weekend , relax , and also it brought a foreign culture to them , broadening their knowledge .
In addition to this , one weekend ticket for all the events was only £ 10 . This was excellent . It meant people only spent pocket - money , and then they could watch all the events at the weekend . For them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend .
Moreover , the stars and artists were from only six countries . In my opinion , if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries , it will make the festival more exciting , more interesting , and in my opinion , some of the concert halls were too small . The people in there could n't even go to the loo , because it was too crowded .
These are only my immature views . If it is considerable for you , I will be very pleased . Thank you very much .
It was very uncomfortable for me .
Today I received your letter . It is the most wonderful news I have heard in a long time .
I am so pleased that I won this prize that I can not explain how grateful I am .
Because of this situation I will be very busy in the first week of July , and I would appreciate it if you could give me the option to begin my " Camp California " experience on July 10th .
About the accommodation I would prefer to sleep in a tent , because I have never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
Because I have seen my father playing golf since I was a child I am very keen on this sport , and also I love photography because I have got a great camera .
When I was a child I never liked to go shopping because my Mum spent so much time in the shops that I remember that going shopping with her was a nightmare .
It is amazing how people change over the years For example now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things , and every week I have to buy something .
But these days shopping is not always enjoyable , because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price , at the end of the season it is half price . I find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes .
Anyway , shopping is always satisfying for rich people , because they can afford it and they do n't mind paying the full price for their clothes .
Modern technology ca n't not transform our daily life .
The inventions of the aeroplane , of the train and of the car , have reduced the distances of the world , so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day .
Everything has changed : style , colour , quality . Fashion .
We saw almost all kinds of skirts , trousers , coats , skirts and even hats - which until now have been the main point of many fashion creatures .
Grey and black - like the seasons , like people 's characters , like all the night and dark surrounding us .
In the advertisement , it said that Danny Brook was starring , but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing .
As you can understand , it was a dreadful time and I want my money back as a consolation for the disappointment I had .
I support this idea which is convenient both for the public and the organisers .
It is awful !
However , we promised our parents to do some cleaning every week .
What is more , there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipment .
The second is nuclear weapons and the many wars in which modern equipment is used .
To sum up , as far as I am concerned , modern technology has changed my life completely .
Last week , during my holiday in London , I had the opportunity to see the show " Over the Rainbow " at the Circle Theatre .
The day of the show , we got to the theatre at 19:30 .
Third , the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef did not show up .
You can feel the fresh air and listen to the animals . This will be a great opportunity !
I am not good at either activity , but it will be a pleasure to try them , especially surfing . I would like to feel the wind in my hair , and enjoy how quickly the board goes over the sea .
I mean , it is too crowded , you have to wait such a long time before you can pay , and most of the things are too expensive !
I was looking forward to a great evening , but much to my surprise , that was not exactly the case : there were no discounts available , such as were mentioned in the advertisement ; the show started 45 minutes late ; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook had been replaced by someone else .
Yours faithfully ,
I will take the example of the use of the Internet .
I am writing to you because yesterday I went to the musical " Over the Rainbow " and I had a bad evening .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because this is the beginning of my holidays , and I would not like to miss some of my school classes .
Besides , I would prefer to stay in a tent , because I got used to being in tents since I spend my holidays every summer with my friends in the hills .
In addition , I would prefer playing tennis .
I also like surfing . I think it is a dangerous sport , but I know how to do it , because of the fact that last year a professional surfer taught me .
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSICAL SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " WHICH WAS PERFORMED LAST WEEK .
YOURS SINCERELY
Because I am a university student , I have got classes until the middle of June and I have to attend a ' Research and Development Conference ' at the end of June .
Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as an assistant from the beginning of August .
I always want to buy T - shirts , Jeans , Skirts , cosmetics , haribands , accessories , rings , earrings , bracelets , shoes , hats , bags , fancy stationery , interior stuff and CDs .
Instead of buying something , I buy some fresh food and Ice - cream .
I can try all the shoes , clothes , hats , accessories and jackets on .
Actually , I could have a chance to ask her about music , her favourite artist and her hobby .
Likewise , there were no discounts available .
Because of all these inconveniences , I ask you for a total refund .
So when Caroline , his girlfriend , told him something personal and very important , because she trusted in him , immediately he went to see one of his friends to tell him the secret .
So immediately she went to Pat , angry , in order to argue with him , saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved , and that it was n't the first time that he was n't capable of keeping a secret .
But after I climbed two steps more , my right foot slipped . I nearly fell , but luckily my hand caught a rock . It was dangerous , but I did n't have any choice . Finally I did it .
I think it was definitely not the perfect evening guaranteed in your advertisement .
I was terribly annoyed !
I am always available on my mobile phone , which is also boring sometimes !
I often go on the Internet to find information when studying a particular subject more closely ( university technology sites ) .
At work my particular job involves two standard PCs with specific software plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network ( SUN ) operating system and a special computer that my firm is now developing .
I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention .
For example , if you were hurt seriously like cutting your leg off , the new medical technology could rebuild part of your body .
Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security cameras which have been combined with modern technology .
In conclusion , I conciderly said we has been charged by morder technology in two ways .
I am not very good at painting , but I choose it because it is a good opportunity to do it .
I do n't want to disappoint you , but I am beginner !
In this book , Heathcliff as a child was n't a bad character , but the situations he lived through with the Earnshaw family , where he grew up , made him rude , aggressive and noisy .
Before Heathcliff died he achieved what he wanted .
In your letter you ask me to choose between tents or log cabins . Well I prefer to stay in a log cabin .
It is more comfortable and I am afraid of wild animals .
The other activity I like very much is swimming .
First we had to prepare the stands with food and drink and buy something which had been forgotten .
He is very beautiful !
Fortunately we had no problem .
I was very proud of myself and the work I had done .
Modern technology has completely changed my daily life , which has become more comfortable , and easier .
Thank you for the excellent programme you have organised for our class .
We would like to inform you that we are all extremely interested in this show and that it could be a great opportunity for us because entrance is free for students .
We would like to ask if we could go to this show on the 15th March instead of doing the visit to the Science Museum .
Who has never dreamed of being a famous singer , sportsman , actor or a politician ?
Firstly , this is because there are a lot of scandal magazine readers .
What a catastrophe !
A disaster !
Also , I used to assist my brother , who is a professional photographer .
When I read the advertisement for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems .
The advertisement says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them .
The advertisement also says that there are discounts available but this is not true , there were none .
Why do you give this information in an advertisement ?
I have only one question about the baby 's accommodation .
So , you wo n't believe me , but I enjoyed helping at an Oasis concert .
Me and my friend were there to hear the sound - check , and when I understood what was happening on the stage , I decided to help them .
Of course you know I 'm a singer , so I came back quickly to my home , I picked up my microphone , and I handed it to the singer .
Can you imagine ?
I will consider taking this complaint to court if I do not receive an acceptable explanation from the theatre .
On the other hand , people in the future will probably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water , the harmful ultra - violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which are the product of a developed and full - grown country .
Therefore , I will suggest that we all nov to keep the environment clean and healthy for the next generation .
When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very excited about the idea of seeing it , plus when I heard about the extras that the circle theatre was offering , it became the best opportunity I ever had to attend a musical of that type , but instead of being the best evening I ever had , it was a total disaster and that 's the reason why I am writing to you .
First , the actors that the Circle theatre publicised on their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not there , which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions .
Another point that I want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start ( 19:30 ) but it started at 20:15 , so there was major dissatisfaction with that , but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy , and I am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service , and uncomfortable seats .
Science and Technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays , most of the community of our city , and of the world , where technology has arrived , confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life .
But not everything about technology and computers is good , because many people , and me in a control way , have become computers ' and technology 's slaves , and we can not do anything without a machine , and I am not saying that it 's wrong or bad , and I accept that they make our daily tasks easier , but we have to maintain our independence as humans .
First of all , there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping , which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom .
Also shopping makes people happier by costing a lot of money and it even influences the economic situation more flexibly .
Also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people .
In addition , shop owners often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secretly .
I 'm really pleased I won your competition !
I 'll give you the necessary information about me .
The most suitable time for me is July because in August I intend to go to the countryside , where I have a small farm .
You offer me a lot of activities .
It was absolutely great !
I gave information about correct ways to other places like toilets and medical points .
I looked very carefully at the organisation of the event , you know I 'm interested in it .
I was so surprised to hear from you .
I was really grateful when I received your letter which informed me that I have won first prize in your competition .
Personally I prefer to stay in log cabins because they are much more comfortable than tents .
Unfortunately I am not good at either of them .
I really hate it , because we 're not allowed to wear casual and fashionable clothes , colourful shoes or colourful socks .
I am very excited and looking forward to the new experience I am going to have .
I would prefer to stay in tents because I love the atmosphere of camping , but I would n't mind staying in log cabins .
It is based on information made available by students from each class at school .
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson , because students always make some mistakes while they are practising with their partner , in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times .
Spending time together out of the class is a nice experience .
Firstly , I should say that I would like to travel in July because that is the month which I could most likely have off from work to go on holiday .
That is because , I do not want to seem fussy , but I like to have some luxuries when I am going on holiday and I think sleeping on the floor without electricity may annoy me .
Conversely , painting is an activity which I have never tried before , so I have not any skill in drawing but I would like to start doing that now when I have the chance .
On the other hand , I would like to know some information which could be useful on my holiday like : what type of clothes would be more suitable for me in the Camp ?
I am writing to tell you about my experience at the pop concert last month , where I was helping my friend Nick , who was the bouncer at the venue .
My job was to accommodate to the people of the main sit of the theatre .
So , I hope to see you soon to show you all my photos .
I think it was very clever of me to record that moment which I will never ever forget , and that was the thing that I liked most about that experience .
I 'm writing to you to make a complaint about your musical show : " Over the Rainbow " ... Last week , I , my husband and our two children went to your theatre to have a good time , but we were so disappointed .
Moreover , there were n't any discounts available like writing in your advertisement .
I will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing - up , before this , women spent a long time doing these tasks .
I am writing to give you further information about me which you need for Camp California .
In conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too busy .
1 . Grammar , which is the basis of learning English .
Speaking : it makes you more confident when you talk with other people .
It lets you get more practice .
Writing . This class teaches you how to organise what you want to write .
It is important to practise your English after lessons .
If you have a problem studying , try asking the teachers about which is the best way to study .
Yours sincerely
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you told me I won the first prize .
So I want you to send me some money back for that unpleasant night .
The headmaster wanted to tell the police what we had done so we decided to imprison him in a little house we had twenty kilometres away from the village until we could change his mind .
We took some photos of him naked and told him not to tell anybody about this because if he does we will hang the photos all around the village .
In the following edition the headline was : " Why does a teenager sleep with a toy called Max ? " Everybody laughed at her .
I would like to travel only in July because I will have some holiday at that time .
3 When you are ready to shop , sometimes you know beforehand what is your priority , because probably you need one thing rather than another .
But the best thing that we do , when we go shopping is spend time having lunch at a snack bar , watching movies and playing computer games .
Last month , I worked as a roadie at a Rolling Stones pop concert . I was responsible for the sound .
Some people when they are tired relax by sleeping , reading a book or watching television , but not me .
There are always , at the end of the afternoon , some well - dressed women coming from their offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything .
However , it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable , for example before Christmas or during some special sales .
Secondly , the show began forty - five minutes late and nobody told me what had happened .
I preferred riding a motorbike with the people who studied with me in the Institute .
You have a chance to meet people and now you have an opportunity to select good friends .
I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring , I booked the ticket immediately .
I belong to the generation who have grown up with a lot of new technology .
For example , TV , telephone , microwave etc .
I thought I would never need a mobile phone , but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now I ca n't live without it !
But the invention that I 'm most thankful for is the computer and the Internet !
So , I start every day by switching on my mobile phone , to see if there are any more SMS messages before I go to the library to check my e - mail and that 's just the beginning of the day ...
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin , because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places , so a tent would be inappropriate for me .
I haven't played golf for a long time , so it will be pleasant to do so .
Yours sincerely ,
The fans started shouting and whistling for the show to begin , while I just stood there trying to see what had happened .
When we saw your advertisement for the musical show , over the rainbow , we immediately decided that this would be a perfect evening out .
Thirdly , in your advertisement it said that discounts would be available , but they were not .
I am therefore asking for compensation for our disappointing evening and hope we can reach a solution as soon as possible .
I really like Pat , she 's funny , has a good sense of humour and like me she loves to discuss everything .
I have received your exciting letter , informing me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I much prefer sleeping in tents . It seems more sociable and really sounds like holidays .
So one week before the concert I went to " L'Arena " to meet the other worker and receive the instructions .
I 've had the honour of helping their sound engineer and branching the cables for microphones , guitars etc .
We really started to work like ants the morning before the show .
It was exciting looking at all three men working together and building a stage , and it was interesting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible .
About two hours before the beginning of the show , we met the band and received tickets to go backstage . That was wonderful , maybe better than the concert itself !
That 's a great experience !
Apart from this , photography is one of my favourite hobbies and I usually spend nearly all my spare time doing it and of course I have some diplomas as well .
I would like to request some information about accommodation and if you could specify what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
I feel that this was a good opportunity for me , not only for my professional but also for my personal life .
According to my job , I had to help the teams with the outlights and , of course , it was my first professional experience : in the end I felt like one of them , because they were so kind to me , and I could help a lot and I learnt a lot with this project .
I prefer that kind of accommodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't have it in a tent .
These are my favourite because they have a lot to do with water , but I like them more than surfing .
I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shops in the centre of a big town .
These days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centres , because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of money .
There were 963 people at the " Armageddon " that night !
You must show a great sense of responsibility .
I 'm sure you are jealous now .
Now I am studying and I 'll continue my studies until the end of June .
I think it 's a very useful and helpful thing for my health , especially when I do it with pleasure .
The second of my favourite sports is tennis .
I 've played tennis for ten years . I 'm a professional and I have to be good at it , in any time .
The most enjoyable thing was to dress people .
But when we saw our show and heard how loudly the audience applauded them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time . You should try it and see .
I would like to stay in a tent because I used to go camping at weekends but if there 's any problem I could be very comfortable in a log cabin too .
I have never tried either of them before and as a result I ca n't be good at them but I 've always wanted to sail because I love the sea and now I have the opportunity .
If you do n't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are appropriate for the camp and for the Californian weather .
First of all , we usually go to the shops at the same time as the rest of the world and that 's a little bit complicated because the shops are full and it 's impossible to try accurately .
I would be grateful if you could send me the full details .
In the following paragraphs I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of shopping .
In a supermarket , shop or department store they have many things .
It is very convenient .
Sometimes , there are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue .
Most people enjoy shopping because it is more convenient today but if you found a busy place for shopping or it was not as good as you expected .
Dear Sir or Madam , With reference to your advertisement regarding the musical show " Over the rainbow " I am writing to you with the intention of giving you an impression of our experiences attending the above - mentioned show . We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters .
According to your advertisement the play should have started at 19:30 .
What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given ; not even an apology .
A story of an old seaman leaving his town to prove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught .
Last week I was on holiday in London and I was very disappointed when I visited your theatre .
First of all , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 , but it was delayed until 20.15 , and when the show finally began we were surprised to see that Danny Brook , who was the star of the show , was not playing and someone else had replaced him and he was really disappointing .
Anna told her again : " Pat do n't tell anyone please , especially my brother , everything would be ruined then " . And Pat answered : " Do n't worry I wo n't tell anyone " .
The big secret was that Anna was preparing a surprise party for her brother John and she did n't want anyone to know about it .
It will be a pleasure to give you all the information which you need .
As far as I know accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins .
It 's more convenient for me .
I am a good defender .
I 'd like to know what temperature it will be in July in California and your advice about how much money I will need to have an unforgettable holiday !
If we decide to buy something special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it .
During a prior holiday in London I came across an encouraging advertisement for the show and decided to see it .
Unfortunately , I was very disappointed to find out that there were no discounts available !
In addition , I was very annoyed by the fact that the event had started at 20:15 - not 19:30 as stated in the advertisement .
I 've always enjoyed danger and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough cookie .
Especially now , when ' big - mouth ' Pat has spread the news to literally everyone . I would n't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me .
Furthermore , for the activities I want to select Tennis and Basketball because I have been playing tennis since I was young and basketball because I played for the team in my college as the captain .
Anyway , this was my experience working at the concert . If you have an opportunity to help at any concert you should help because you have a lot of fun as well , OK .
I am writing to you , in reply to the letter I have recently received , to inform you about some details that I am concerned about .
In your letter you presented the possibility of choosing two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join in with basketball and climbing , as I am very good at both of them because I played basketball in my secondary school as captain of the team and due to my long training sessions lifting weights .
There is , as well , the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds , crammed in the small shops during the only day - off you have to buy something you like .
All this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown , particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way through the crowds or while you were queuing to pay .
I 'm the winner of the first prize in your competition and I 'm writing to you to give you some information which was requested by you .
And it 's creating a lot of addicted people , called " shopaholics " .
I am writing to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre .
He told me that it was necessary to do something about it .
As Pat was losing his patience , he decided to talk to him .
I can say that I was very nervous and anxious about what was going to happen .
I am writing this letter to inform you about the decisions I have made regarding your questions .
When I was a child I was afraid of all these little insects that live in the ground and this fear still remains now .
I also think that the log cabin will be much more comfortable than the tent .
Basketball and swimming are the two activities I have chosen .
Finally I would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the money we will need .
I was only responsible for the property of the back stages .
I was shocked and terrified the first time I saw them , but the truth is that they are men like us .
They have a very simple life and behaviour when they are n't on the stage .
Definitely , it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back .
I received your letter about the two weeks I won at camp California in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July because I will have holidays in that month .
Yours sincerely
Also , we will take the drinks from our canteen and there will be a group of musicians for our entertainment .
I was surprised because I did not know what he wanted .
When I went he wanted to tell me that from the next month I would be his personal secretary and my salary would be twice what it was previously .
Unfortunately , the musical show was n't much like that the one the advert had described , and that is why I want to ask you for some money back .
Now I have a new computer , which is very easy to use , and comfortable for my fingers and also faster .
And he can answer me very quickly .
I think it is now the future of big companies to work with the Internet .
I am writing to inform you of some problems we had .
We had to wait over 40 minutes
It seemed to sink into the sea , but fortunately , the storm soon went away .
Finally when it started we noticed to our surprise that it was not the right actor on stage .
Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasant dinner .
Anyway , we definitely know that they 're going to change .
In the paper it was written that the principal actor is " Danny Brook " but it was n't him , it was a different actor whom we had never seen , or heard .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , this sentence is very popular in our school .
I helped to guide foreigners who would like to participate in that .
Thank you for your letter . I was so happy to receive such good news that I could n't believe it .
Regarding the accommodation at Camp California , I prefer to rent a tent , which is going to be more fun , I think , but are the tents singles ?
Is there only one teacher for each sport , and how many are in each group ?
It 's the place where you can meet your friends , where you can talk freely , and there are no teachers . It could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons .
Finally we should film the lunch , which is also a moment for the students , and for the teachers , to relax . We must n't forget to film the staff room because if a school is made of students , it 's also made of teachers .
I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competition for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
First I want to thank you for all the congratulations , and I 'll try to answer all your questions about , for instance , travel and accommodation . I have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July ( because her small children are in summer school at that time .
I was so happy and surprised that first I could not really believe it .
Secondly , regarding the accommodation , I would say I prefer living in a tent rather than in a log cabin because I used to sleep in a tent when I was staying in a local scout camp in my country .
Thirdly , I have chosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favourite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them .
Finally , I would like to ask you whether I have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me .
A group of girls can stay in a shopping centre forever .
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased that I won the first prize in your competition .
In addition to all this , I would appreciate it if you could let me have more details about clothes and how much I shall be paid for the trip .
Another reason is that it will be more useful for foreign students who want to speak English .
The number of foreign students has recently been increasing .
To sum up , it is recommended that speaking classes and school trips should be filmed .
First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to travel .
You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart , the accommodation I would like to have and so on .
Travelling in July , I have to say , would be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and I wish to spend my birthday in the best way possible , so that means there .
I also would prefer to sleep in tents , which are more comfortable , and , because I have been doing lots of camping , I am quite used to this kind of accommodation .
The activities I have chosen both represent a passion for me .
We are writing to you to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , which we saw last week in your Theatre .
The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30 , but it actually started at 20:15 due to a problem with the sound .
We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts were n't available for us , because they did n't accept our student identity cards from Switzerland .
What is the effect it has on your environment ?
The major problem for the industrial cities is to deal with the bad effects of pollution on the environment .
A lot of money is involved in research to stop the increase in levels of pollution .
To sum up , all the improvements come at a price : the condition of the environment .
When it was time to take the final exam , she became ill and she could n't do it so the teachers decided to allow her to pass the course because she had a lot of good marks , but on the other hand the principal disagreed and did n't give permission to pass her .
She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and as is usual the girls from the last course became popular .
Pat , to win her new classmates ' friendship , told everything that she knew about her friends and , because of what Pat said , her friends ended their friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged .
And it is even more difficult to predict what clothes in the future will look like .
I saw the performance and it was not as it was described in the advertisement I read in the local newspaper .
Then , I was planning to buy three £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true , so I could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show .
Finally , I was thinking of having dinner in the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees .
What was supposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening , resulted in a very disappointing time .
So I would be grateful if you paid for a full refund of the money I spent on the tickets .
Computers , radio , CDs , satellite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life .
Another advantage is that , for example , satellite television , which is an example of modern technology , keeps me informed about what is happening in the whole world .
After considering your accommodation offers , I 'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible .
It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast between this and the classroom atmosphere but also show how they are as young people .
On top of everything , the restaurant which was advertised in the advertisement was closed because it was being arranged .
You can imagine how disappointed I felt after that evening , and I am writing to ask you for a refund of part of the money .
But , in other things , I think modern technology hasn't changed my way of life too much : I do more or less the same as I did some years ago : I get up in the morning , go to school , have lunch , study and go out with my friends without being affected by microchips or nuclear energy .
I have happily received your reply and I want to thank you for this marvellous prize you have given me .
After helping to do that and many other things , my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day ( the group ) left , they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did , and shook our hands .
It started at 20:15 leaving us waiting for forty five minutes .
In the future people will wear clothes made of polyester and nylon because cotton and wool will be rare and expensive .
Also I think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution - I think there will be many such places in a hundred years - and a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will do damage to the human skin .
Now , it is already possible to send our shopping list by computer , and this option , in the next few years , will become the most common one .
The new technologies will probably produce a considerable revolution in some essential parts of the house .
For example , we will have computerized ovens , microwaves and freezers , or we will probably have central heating controlled through the Internet from our office .
Firstly , log cabins are more comfortable than tents .
Is there a possibility of exchanging different currencies to US dollars ?
When you think of shopping , it reminds you of going out ( mostly ) with friends , looking for new things like clothes , accessories etc . and buying them .
Then in the advertisement it said that the performance began at 19.30 .
I was very nervous .
So this evening was terrible .
And now I request my money back .
Among them , the mobile telephone , computers , telefaxes , different appliances for the kitchen , machines which help housekeepers to do any work about the house .
So with the appearance of new modern technology people have got much more free time .
Some years ago people , especially students , had to run to libraries in order to find a book about something .
I use the Internet very often , and I must say it is very convenient .
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends , or if something terrible has happened to me , I do not have to run somewhere to find a telephone box .
With it people do their work more quickly and successfully .
I saw an advertisement which made it seem very attractive to me .
Firstly , I decided to go see your show to be entertained by the performance of Danny Brook so I was very sad to find another actor on the stage .
It 's unbelievable it was 45 minutes late .
We stayed with a host family in a suburb of the city .
The man said it was OK this time and we got in quite easily , we 'd made it .
I 'm excited to be going on holiday there and , thanks to you , I will realize a dream that I always wanted to do .
Yours faithfully
On Monday we could first go to the Science Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich .
Everyone knows you because of the journalists , so you ca n't just ignore them , can you ?
I am writing to you because of the unpleasant evening I have had recently .
Earlier I had seen an advertisement for the show but the information on it was false .
The last thing is that it was impossible to go to the theatre restaurant because it was closed .
I would like to write about how it has influenced my daily life .
I am a student at a technical university .
When I needed some information I had to go to the library to find it in books or newspapers .
The computer is helpful when I want to contact somebody very fast .
The second thing is that when I needed a phone card to call somebody I had to stand in a long queue .
Although we would like to visit the science museum , we can leave it to the next opportunity . What we suggest doing is instead of going to the museum in the morning we go to the Leisure Show and keep the afternoon programme the same .
I knew I could not make any movement for my safety but I did and to my surprise it ran away .
Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programme of my school , which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July .
Concerning the activities , as a matter of fact tennis is my favourite sport and I am very keen on it . For the second activity I would like to enrol in surfing , because my husband , who is already a proficient surfer , keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport , and I think it is worthwhile trying , therefore I 'd love to be in the beginners ' group .
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking , computing , make - up , languages , geography , to culture and civilization .
Once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life . Depending on their levels of proficiency , they have to study for instance languages which I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way . Students have to manage to speak at least three languages .
Another important lesson to film is " culture and civilization , " so people will know that the waitresses trained at this school are not simply , as the French say , " pot - au - fleurs " , beautiful faces , but also well - read people .
Last but not least is the class called " know - how " , which shows students how to cope with unexpected problems even if they are stressed .
To whom it may concern ,
Firstly , the advertisement said that Danny Brook was going to star in the musical but it turned out to be a completely different person , which was very disappointing .
Secondly , according to the advertisement , the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15 , which caused me problems .
With all the dissatisfaction above , therefore , I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it should have been .
She saw some familiar faces on the other side of the street .
And if it is possible , I would rather be accommodated in log cabins because I would not like to share the bathroom facilities with someone who I do not know well .
I am in the school swimming team and I am interested in photography professionally .
Could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend ?
And what 's more , there were n't any discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed : the only people who could enter were the actors and the staff .
Well , it seems that it was n't my perfect evening and for all these reasons I demand to have my money back , I wasted £ 20 to see a show which does n't respect the programme I paid for .
Science and technology can be useful : see for example the use of TV in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to get further information about something that interests you .
Again we 're so sorry that we are causing you inconvenience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us .
But we could have everything we want .
Home might be a mixture with modern styles and a natural appearance as well .
These days a lot of countries have been worried about lands that ca n't have enough space to build houses .
Because we are living a computerised life , we 'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well .
On the other hand , what might still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home , such as a beautiful garden , a small terrace .
Last week I went to the Circle theatre , for which you are responsible , to see the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I think modern technology has changed mankind 's life a lot , especially since last century .
The changes brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or without a part of it .
In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity : I live on a little mountain at 160 metres altitude so I can not go to the city using a bicycle . Because of my " isolation " the telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and the Internet to study or do research , because there are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town .
Only those who get good marks can take part in these activities , so sports activities are seen as a prize , so while the students are playing basketball , tennis , volleyball ... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces , and our volleyball team is excellent .
Be careful , my own technology can kill me .
The only convenient time to travel is in July .
This part had to be saved for later because the concert organiser wanted to know the exact number of visitors .
Here , I had to check the bags and coats of the girls .
I think it 's because the last time I travelled ( with my friends ) , we stayed in log cabins , and when I was sleeping I felt something moving on my skin , then I woke up frightened and when I opened my eyes , I saw lots of big ants !
Gratefully
I met all the staff , and Ricky took lots of photographs with me and gave me an autographed Record .
I am also writing to make a suggestion and to give you my opinion about next year 's festival .
An international arts festival is a great idea , but at the last die there were stars and artists from only six countries , and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures .
I could not listen to one of my favourite classical concerts , " La Moldava " by Smetana .
In Italy there are n't a lot of rules at school and they are n't very strict .
I am writing to you in order to describe my last visit to your theatre .
Unfortunately , I am very disappointed about the organisation of your company .
Firstly , the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later .
I do n't know whether it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money , or whether it was on June 7 ( my visit ) only , but I do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed .
Because people have fast and comfortable cars , they are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively - they can often visit their friends and travel much more .
Secondly , we can do our jobs today more efficiently .
I found your advertisement in the tourist board offices and as the musical " Over the rainbow " seemed to be a good option I chose it .
After a long time walking we decided to return and now the weather was so hot we decided to find a place to drink something .
I 'm really very unlucky .
However , we saw an advertisement for " The London Fashion and Leisure Show " and we would all like to go and see it .
We could immediately see that it was broken .
All synthetic material will be uncomfortable for these people .
Women will prefer long skirts and short blouses and jackets .
Men will wear as usual - a suit .
For special occasions , for example a party , a concert , people will dress very smartly . I think that it will be dresses , and suits sewed by the well - known tailors .
I think that we will observe a few slow changes in fashion , but I hope that new clothes will always be pleasant for people .
As we have seen the advertisement for the programme the school arranged for us as a farewell activity , we are very appreciative and would like to thank you for your kindness , as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class , which we have hardly done at all .
So this is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design , because in this show there will be a fashion show , a demonstration from make - up artists , and a contest for hair stylists .
Furthermore , most of the famous brand of sportswear companies will be at this exhibition with their new products for the coming season .
Anyway , instead of going shopping in the afternoon session , we will attend the show .
We all think the programme is organised well . In particular we 're so keen on the idea of going to the National Art Gallery , to see the work of the greatest painters in the world .
I 'm writing to you because we saw a great advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really would like to go to see that show .
I think it 's a great opportunity , because we will have a chance to see the latest fashion , leisure and sports wear , and also the way to do the perfect make - up and hairstyle .
In my opinion , we can have a great time there , and entrance is free of charge for students , which is very important as well .
We thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation , sunbathing and joy .
However , the truth was a little bit different .
The weather had changed suddenly , and there was no more sun , but strong wind and heavy rain .
Despite that we were still thinking optimistically .
We were thinking is so many other activities to relax and enjoy ourselves then sunbathing on the beach .
The sky went completely black , so at first it was difficult to see where everybody was .
I looked around and I realised a friend of mine was still in the sea , and fighting against the storm , trying to get to the shore .
Everything was looking so dangerous but fortunately it ended well .
I would like to apologise to you for my controversial opinion but I feel really disappointed .
I came to London for a short holiday to meet new people and to have a taste of English culture .
I 'd seen your advertisement which recommended the play ' Over the rainbow ' and I liked it very much .
In the advertisement ' DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE ' was written . Shall I ask you one question ? - Why were n't they available ?
Everybody was shocked and I was trying to keep the faith .
Nevertheless , after the show I was very hungry so I went to the theatre restaurant and what did I see ?
Finally - you offered a wonderful evening but I must say that if I had known that it was going to be like that I would n't have wasted my time .
I feel entitled to write this letter and I feel the opportunity .
Yours faithfully
The main advantage is that it provides you with all the information that you need .
Furthermore you can play with the computer , and unfortunately this fact especially has changed my life .
On the other hand , playing games and using a computer widens my brain so , as you can see , this modern stuff has got many advantages and disadvantages .
I saw the advertisement for the International Arts Festival which is a great idea .
Firstly I want to congratulate you on the festival .
I have a surprise for you .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
Secondly , you have a lot of choices and you do not know what to buy .
Lastly , there is a recycling problem , which many people do not care about .
In my opinion , small shops and the street markets should be supported . On the other hand , the big supermarkets should think more about the recycling problem , which will be the most important problem in the near future .
Secondly , the show started at 20.15 .
I will be glad if you will send my money back .
Yours faithfully ,
This was the reason why we were in horrible trouble with the police .
Let 's go back to the beginning of this story .
There was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank .
We found the solution to this desperate situation - to say nothing to anybody .
Our class really appreciate your preparing this programme , especially with regard to Monday 's attraction .
We are extremely interested in visiting London .
In the last edition of ' London 's Guide ' we saw an advert for ' The London Fashion and Leisure Show ' , which will be held on Tuesday and it lasts from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The offer mentions the ' latest fashions ' , which we are incredibly interested in .
Nowadays famous people do n't have an easy life .
They are always attracted by naughty journalists , which have a desire to earn big money for writing an extremely good report or article .
When choosing this style of life they should realise what their life would be like .
On the other hand , their life has no privacy .
Some people may argue , but I think that politicians and film stars belong to the public .
In conclusion , I believe that we have a right to be informed about their lives , providing that journalists respect some important rules .
We think we 'll have one free hour before the River trip .
Regarding accommodation , I would prefer to have a log cabin . It would be better to leave money or anything in without worrying about theft . I 've always dreamed about climbing but I have never had the opportunity to try this sport .
I have already thought about a change to the programme .
But the worst thing about " London 's newest and best musical show " , as you called it , was the absence of Danny Brook .
The actor who was " dancing " was horrible .
I want you to give me back my money . I hope that in future you will correct all these mistakes .
That was supposed to be a joke from my " colleagues " !
I enjoyed it and here are some feelings and advice for next year .
They do n't fancy going into the crowded shop .
I received your letter congratulating me for having won the first prize in your competition .
I am very grateful and I want to thank you very much for letting me go on this trip .
They are much more comfortable than tents .
Apart from calling them , I also helped build the stage , and took care of the lights .
I can tell you that it was a wonderful experience .
But Pat , coming back home , told her mother everything .
The advertisement I had read did not tally with the performance .
Today it is used practically in all spheres and its influence on people is not unnoticeable .
I am writing to tell you that the students of my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion And Leisure Show .
I had to become a burglar again and steal jewellery from the jewellers nearby .
As I knew the techniques to break into a place without being noticed , I should not have been afraid but tonight I had to steal the most precious diamond in the country , which was very well protected .
There were lasers all over the place , which I had to be careful of .
I got into the car and gave the jewellery in exchange for my brother , took him and left the place .
The programme offers enjoyment and education , which is essential for young people .
Secondly , because we do not have to pay for the tickets .
We have already organised our visit in a new programme .
We are looking forward to hearing from you .
The future is unpredictable and human beings are afraid of dangers , such as tornados or earthquakes .
What we really need in the next millennium is love , that is what will keep all the family together forever .
Life is too short to think about possessions .
Our houses will change because of new technology , which may make our lives more comfortable .
What depends on us , is the atmosphere we will have in our houses .
The home of the future , for me , is a place of happiness .
We can not be aware of future technology , but we might still have some feelings for each other .
I have swum since I was in primary school .
In particular , I liked cleaning the stage , because I could stand on a famous singer 's stage and I could feel his enthusiasm , even though I had to clean it .
I go to the beach almost every weekend to improve my surfing - it is the sport I like best - and I think it would be a nice opportunity to practise surfing too .
There are some things I would like to ask about : the type ( and quantity ) of Clothes I will have to take , and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff ( like raincoats ) .
Since we were kids people have told us stories about two sides in conflict : the good and the bad side .
What was more , it was closed because of refurbishing .
When I was a university student , I had to find out some information for my homework .
I imagined where other countries are like England .
I am still a student and I saw in the advertisement that there were some discounts available .
The first thing I do every day , when I get up , is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine .
All day I speak with the majority of my colleagues by telephone or e - mail .
If I haven't enough time to cook I prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave oven .
The home of the Future
Technology is changing very fast and at the same time as I 'm writing my article about the future maybe technologists have made a new oven which co - operates with your refrigerator and has a program to make dinner for you every day without you having to do anything .
What about rooms which can sense your mood and act according to that ? If you are tired for example then your stereo might put some relaxing music on and turn down the light a little bit .
I think that everyone should think not just about the positive side of technology but also the negative .
First of all , the advertisement I got placed emphasis on Danny Brook 's starring in the show , but actually , a disappointing , unknown actor played his part , and I wonder whether he had real skills .
To make matters worse , not only was the restaurant closed , for no apparent reason , but also the discounts that were said to be available were not .
We are all excited about the programme you 've prepared for us , especially about visiting the National Art gallery .
We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show in a newspaper .
We think it could be a great opportunity for us because we 'll see the fashion show might shop for leisure and sports wear and all the girls in our class are interested in new styles in make - up and hairdressing .
A scientist could discover the 4th dimension and we 'd get unlimited space inside the house .
You could tell your wardrobe what clothes you 'd like to wear , your hob will cook your favourite meals and your refrigerator will send orders to the supermarkets to buy the food .
I AM WRITING TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE .
I HAVE CHOSEN THOSE BECAUSE I AM QUITE GOOD AT PLAYING BASKETBALL AND I SING EVERY WEEKEND IN THE CHOIR OF THE LOCAL CHURCH AS WELL .
I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL MY QUERIES .
THANKS FOR THE KIND LETTER YOU SENT ME LAST WEEK .
BUT TO MAKE THE THING BETTER I WAS CHOSEN TO HELP THE BAND AND THE ORGANISERS OF THE CONCERT .
AS YOU KNOW , I AM A SOUND TECHNICIAN , SO I HELPED THEM TO SET UP THE SOUND EQUIPMENT AND THE INSTRUMENTS PROPERLY .
I am writing to you in order to get my money back , concerning the musical show : OVER THE RAINBOW .
First of all : the actors who were mentioned in the advert are not the same as the ones on stage .
Or special flying shoes , and maybe you would have a screen on your watch to watch your favourite soap operas .
It could be any day but please let me know nearer the time .
I recently was in London , staying in my sister 's home , and I went to see " Over the Rainbow " .
Sorry , but none of this is professional , and I am going to make a demand exactly because you do n't have that , if you do n't give me my money back .
But there was a little problem and it was that my parents did n't let me go to discos alone , so I had to go illegally , and I decided I would do it .
To summarise the night , I am going steady with him , and he took me home .
All the truth was then told , and now I am grounded for life .
She definitely does n't know how to keep secrets .
I want to know if I can take my cellular phone , too .
To Mr. Smith , Circle Theatre 's manager
We had prepared this quite a long time ago , this trip to the capital and saved a lot of money as well .
When we saw your leaflet that mentioned " London 's newest and best musical show " , we were so enthusiastic and curious that we immediately bought the tickets .
First of all , I think we should consider the way people are dressing at present to see how it 's going to be developed in the future .
In 100 years , it 's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic , latex , everything possible , as a way to create their own clothes .
Finally , life in France is crazy , this is the tradition .
I am writing to complain because I was really disappointed by your musical show , which is " Over the Rainbow " , last week .
First of all , the advertising shown us starring , which is Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . However , when I saw it , the musical starred completely different actors . I was really disappointed about it .
Now then , how was this advertising , it was completely different . I am really disappointed with your musical . I am asking you for my money back , because I did n't enjoy your musical .
I am writing a composition about " How modern technology has changed your daily life " . This is our subject .
This modern technology gets closer between person to another person , get close between worldwide , so that , this modern technology changed our daily life so different .
First of all I would like to travel only in July because I am going to work in August to earn money and after that ( from September to June ) I go to university as usual .
About accommodation at Camp California , I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer to nature .
That show was n't what it was supposed to be and it is for that reason that I am writing to you .
I am writing to ask for the refund of the £ 55 which I spent on the ticket for that miserable show .
All the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with their difficult tasks .
Going shopping is a good thing when you do n't know what else to do but it also has many disadvantages .
I am writing to complain about the musical show at the Circle Theatre .
By using a car I not only get an easy way to move around , but I also destroy the environment .
For instance with the arrival of the Internet , the new digital television and the researchers in medicine , we are discovering how we can change our lives with only the press of a button , or look for something new by only thinking about it ... we realize that the new technology has just begun to advance , and it is likely in a few years we will be very advanced in this way .
In my opinion the new technologies have more advantages than disadvantages . My reasons for saying this are that we can live better , we also have more ways of knowing now to live healthily and how to spend our free time .
As you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones I want to do , but I decided to take swimming and photography , because I am very good at swimming and because I am currently attending a photography course in Vienna .
There was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was OK , because there really were thousands of people .
Edi Vedder even talked to me about their programmes !
My golf teacher is my father and I 've only played in a practising centre , but my father and his friends say I have good talent for golf .
Firstly , we should definitely put the news review lesson in , because we start every morning with that class and it is where we have a lot of discussion .
I think , next we can film either the development class or the society class , because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class .
Secondly time starts at 19:30 on the leaflet but it actually started at 20:15 .
Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because your excuse of being used at that moment .
It said in the leaflet that this would be a perfect evening out , while it was not that at all .
She was so frightened and sad that she had no energy .
Furthermore , no discounts were available .
You have a responsibility to the audiences .
These things are very convenient ; on the other hand , there are lots of disadvantages .
Unfortunately it is not so cheap .
I was very surprised when I got the letter from you .
And you need some information from me .
I would love to try surfing because it is a very interesting sport and uses a lot of power and energy so now is the end of the letter .
And I want to know more about the money . Can you give me more information about the money that I need to bring with me ?
Now let 's start with shopping at the Beverley Centre .
The Beverley Centre area is the place that the teenagers like to go shopping at the most .
Because everyone has different thinking like Beverley Centre if you go there every day or every week for shopping you will get very bored because sometimes there are too many people everywhere , like in the restaurants and shops .
Because all the smells in the market are awful - there is the smell of the meat and dirty water , black and smelly water , all over the market street .
We hope to see you at the party and have a wonderful time together .
It means swimming at the wonderful beaches , tasting the delicious food and having a wonderful time every day and every night with your friends .
I am writing to complain about the musical , OVER THE RAINBOW , and also about the service .
Secondly , in your advertisement I had read " Times 14.30 and 19.30 " .
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future , to offer me my money back .
After that a being climbed out of the potato .
I could not believe my ears .
The being moved its hand forward and .....
Immediately after I heard , " And do n't forget your homework " .
Moreover there will be a demonstration of modern make - up and new different , shaking hairstyles .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
The wind was blowing and the heavy rain was drumming against our bedroom window .
As a postman , Peter had to deliver letters around our little village .
Recently , I had the opportunity to go to your Circle Theatre event .
Unfortunately I never thought it could be so disappointing .
The first problem happened at the box office because there were absolutely no discounts available .
Because of all this , what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definitely one of the worst .
Technology is always getting better .
And it is responsible for many changes in my life , and I think I would n't be able to live without it anymore .
Nowadays , with the Internet it has become easier to do school work and I also like to chat with other people or maybe read the latest news about my favourite football team .
I also recently got a cellular phone and I do n't know how I lived so long without one - because it helps to solve problems so quickly , it 's really amazing .
But for me , the best thing is definitely the microwave .
There are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me .
Lastly , can you please tell me how much money would be appropriate to take ?
At the end of the concert , when it was after midnight and everyone had already left , the group came up to each of us ( who helped out ) and thanked us personally !
Now I have the opportunity so I shall inform you fully .
The opportunity of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance .
She is a very nice person . I managed to scavenge an autograph for you as well , I will put it in the envelope .
I am looking forward to receiving your answer and do n't forget that it is a surprise birthday party .
In spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together .
And the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family , they do the same as their parents and have a happy family .
Besides that the most important thing is that these children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got psychological problems and they are useful in society .
To sum up , family life is the most important thing for children 's psychological world which helps them in their education , job and their marriage in future .
I'M WRITING THIS LETTER BECAUSE TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS IN LONDON AND I WENT TO THE THEATRE TO SEE YOUR MUSICAL SHOW . AND THROUGH SEEING IT MY FAMILY HAD A VERY DISAPPOINTING EVENING AND SO DID I . YOU CAN READ BELOW MY POINT OF VIEW REGARDING THIS .
FIRST OF ALL , WE COULDN'T SEE THE FAMOUS ACTOR " DANNY BROOK " BECAUSE HE WAS ILL . I THINK THAT THE MUSICAL SHOW SHOULD HAVE BEEN CANCELLED FOR THIS ALONE .
NOWADAYS THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVE A COMPUTER IN THEIR HOME AND SOMETIMES WE ASK OURSELVES IF MODERN TECHNOLOGY WILL CHANGE OUR DAILY LIFE .
About accommodation I would prefer a cabin , because I suffer from allergies , and I think a tent would not be very suitable for my health .
I won last summer 's swimming competition in the school . Although I 'm not very good at surfing I like it , and I always practise on my holidays every year .
I would like to know if it is necessary for me to bring some money , and if we will have time to visit the City . About the clothes , do I have to bring some winter clothes ?
I 'm very grateful to hear from you .
You asked me to tell you about my experience helping at the concert last week .
I was asked to put all the chairs in order for the singer . This was only in the beginning . After that I needed to check all the microphones .
After that all the singers arrived and I was in charge of greeting them and giving them something to drink .
You can imagine how excited I was , especially because I always wanted some photographs of them and this was a special moment and I realised I had n't brought my camera . I was very sad .
Actually this was because most things I saw were different from what the advertisement said .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
One day , we went to a party , where she met some of the most popular girls in the school .
Afterwards , when I saw her , she laughed at me and the next day all the school knew everything about me .
I would like to have accommodation in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent .
So as we can see - shopping is not always enjoyable .
About the accommodation , I would rather stay in a log cabin .
For weeks I 'd been planning to go to the theatre with some close relatives and friends but the problems that we had made this perfect night a disaster for all of us .
To begin with , in your advertisement you say that Danny Brooks will be starring in the show but instead there was a different actor , which made us very disappointed .
Another thing that is said in the advertisement is that the evening show will start at 7:30 but there was a forty - five minute delay . The crowd got really upset and we were going to leave at the first chance we got .
If you do n't do as I say , an article in the biggest newspaper will definitely change your mind .
This is something that has troubled many people , especially those who work in the fashion industry .
Fashion has made great progress since the early days .
In the early 90s it was in fashion for women to wear only skirts .
Nowadays women wear really short skirts , short t - shirts , short tops , and cut their hair short just like men .
Boys pierce their bodies just like girls do and vice versa .
People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers design but no one wears .
I took the decision to write to you because I would like to complain about your theatre .
I am writing to you because last night I expected to have a wonderful evening and unfortunately I was very disappointed .
I and some friends decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show .
We were so excited .
We are on holiday and we decided to go .
We had never been to a musical show and we thought that it was a new opportunity .
I believe that some other actors maybe made the whole story more interesting .
The first was very early , at 2:30 , and the other at 7:30 .
We went at 7:30 . Finally the musical show started at 8:15 .
We waited one hour .
When the show finished , we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there do n't work if they do n't get their pay first .
I and my friends would be obliged if you would give us back some of the money we paid .
Humans have done many things through the years and made many things possible .
Now we are in the 20th century in which people have been to the moon and discovered medicines for serious illnesses . I live in that century too .
I believe that I am like that , I belong to that century .
I believe modern technology has changed everyone , especially now with computers and all the other machines .
First I want to talk about the computer .
Before , I used some other ways to get information or play or communicate with people .
I can spend so many hours because day by day I discover new things .
Maybe it is not good because you do n't have the opportunity to meet people and talk face - to - face . Apart from computers we have the telephone , TV , and gyms .
About the TV . I spend many hours in front of the TV . It helps me to relax and spend some hours alone .
Exactly happened and with telephone .
About the gyms , I like them very much . Those places have so many machines that you can easily lose weight and develop a wonderful body .
Now , in conclusion we can see , or I can see , that maybe I am not a very sociable person but I can do whatever I want and take whatever I want only through technology .
Firstly , I was disappointed , because the actor Danny Brook did not appear in the show .
I am writing to complain about what it says in the advertisement is not true .
3 You recommended the restaurant after the show .
It would be great if you considered returning my money as soon as possible .
This is not normally what people wear every day .
The 2nd F is ' fulfil ' wear ever you have in your mom 's cupboard .
For example long baggy trousers , which cover your bright brick shoes .
Wherever you go everyone would love you because of your trousers , which would clean away all the rubbish that is on the road .
If I can choose my accommodation , I prefer staying in a tent .
I prefer this accommodation because I think it 's easier to meet people when you stay in a tent , near them , than when you stay in a log cabin .
TO ANSWER YOUR NEXT QUESTION , I WOULD RATHER STAY IN A LOG CABIN . THE THING IS , I HAVE A PHOBIA ABOUT INSECTS AND MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED THAT I SHOULD SLEEP IN AN ENCLOSED AREA .
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF IT 'S NECESSARY TO TAKE MONEY , FOOD AND CLOTHES WITH ME .
NOW THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THIS YEAR TO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT THE BEST LESSONS AND ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAVE IN SCHOOL , EVERYTHING POSSIBLE OF COURSE WITH HELP OF TEACHER MS . WESTBROOK .
IT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS VIDEO THAT THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON OUR WRITING AND CULTURE LESSONS .
FOR CULTURE LESSONS WE DON'T NEED TO GO SO FAR BACK IN TIME ; FOR THE LAST 60 YEARS OUR CULTURE HAS BEEN CHANGING ENORMOUSLY AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT COMPUTERS , WARS , CARS , WEAPONS , ETC ....
ALTHOUGH LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IT ,
OUR SCHOOL HAS A SPORTING IMAGE . I THINK THE VIDEO WOULD ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO DO SPORTS AND BE GOOD ATHELETES .
I have received a letter from you saying that I have won the first prize in your competition and you need some information from me .
I would like to travel in July because my holidays are only in that month and the weather in California is better then .
They liked me so much and invited me to be responsible for the lights and sound .
I told them that I will think about it but I believe I will accept the job .
The most incredible part was the laser show .
They were drawing a lot of things in the sky during the concert .
I 'm sure that you are going to love it .
About my accommodation at the camp , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it 's safer than being in a tent and because you sleep more comfortably .
The activities that I would like to do are singing , because my friend told me that I 'm good at it , and the other activity that I would like to do is climbing because I think it is very exciting although I have never tried climbing , because there are no mountains in my city .
I appreciate the opportunity that you are giving me and I 'm very grateful to you guys .
Well on march 11th there was a group here in brazil called " Los Jagoares " , they sing pop music . And they are one of my favourites and as you know I have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if I would like to help them to install the speakers , microphones etc ... and I said , " Sure man . "
Last Sunday my friends and I saw that advertisement about the play you were supposed to put on .
We waited there for forty - five minutes for it to start !
We really got bored , like all the other people there .
And then delate forty - five minutes to present the show .
That was very disappointing .
My friends and I demand our money back very soon .
And please do not be very surprised if you receive more letters about this .
Pat , my sister and I felt very responsible .
I did n't believe him at first .
But I could see that his face was happy and he was n't telling lies .
I could n't believe it . I had not seen him for five years .
How are you ? I 'm not so well , and that 's the reason why I 'm writing this letter to you .
Unfortunately your advertisement said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later .
Children are not studying as much as they ought to , because they are watching TV , talking on the phone or even playing computer games .
This is also another cause of heart attacks .
Your advertisement for the musical Over the rainbow said it was London 's newest and best musical show . I agree with that because it is a wonderful show but it said that Danny Brook would be starring in it .
In the advertisement it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show , and that is what I did , but when I got there it was shut for no reason .
Pat could n't resist and told her brother Jacob . He was quite shocked about the news because he misunderstood .
There , Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him .
It was all a misunderstanding .
I hope all my wishes are realisable .
I can not bear it when somebody says something and then does just the opposite .
It must be our decision whether to stay and eat there , or not .
To cut a long story short , because of everything I have said above , the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my money back , and for you it is just to give it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointment you have made me suffer .
HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAILY LIVES ?
In our grandparents ' time life was so different that we can not believe that this huge change to our daily life happened in only one hundred years or less .
Furthermore , as we all know , daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks ( as our grandparents used to do ) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder .
Strange as it seems , we now have all types of machine or specialised technology to make our daily life more comfortable and less stressful .
I am writing to thank you for notifying me about the competition and I would be very grateful to give to you the information that was requested in your letter .
About the Accommodation , I would like you to take careful consideration of the fact that I am asthmatic , so I would appreciate it if you could reserve a bed in a log cabin .
If you have this opportunity one day , you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like this just to get a free pass .
If this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened , but I had to wait till quarter past eight to watch the show , instead of it beginning at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement .
As a conclusion to that horrible evening I decided to visit your theatre restaurant once the show had finished , but what a surprise when I found it closed .
It consisted in having to memorise a whole book of 250 pages in order to pass a final exam .
On the exam day everybody answered every question correctly .
Secondly , although the log cabins appeal to me , I would prefer a tent because I think it is more comfortable and attractive .
Nowadays most people are attracted to shopping centers , which are not always enjoyable .
Fourthly , that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy too many things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by yourself .
First of all , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 , but it started at 20.15 .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Nowadays , there are more and more people who want to become designers and the competition is increasing .
I always wanted to go and see the USA !
In my opinion , staying in tents is more exciting than staying in log cabins .
I 'm very happy about this because I spent most of my school life playing sports , especially basketball .
They mixed up our traditional music and pop music .
In reply to your letter received on the 13th of June , I first would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me to have been chosen .
In fact there would be only one possibility in July because I will finish my exams at the end of that month and begin vocational training the 1st of August .
Then , during the concert , I helped to serve the beers at the bar . I met a lot of interesting people while I was serving drinks .
Everything was very interesting , but what I particularly liked about the experience was the human relations .
I met a lot of different people and they all taught me something new about behaviour or compassion .
I prefer to stay in a tent so I go camping every summer and am used to sleeping in tents .
I 'm very good at swimming as I have been a member of various swimming clubs since I was 6 and I chose photography because I have a new camera and want somebody to teach me how to use it .
Introduction : To support an idea to make a short video about daily life at our school I have spent some time discussing it with other students , and observing and analysing an average day in our school and have come up with some suggestions .
I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as the annual sports tournament or welcoming evening for new students .
Conclusion : To sum up the above I 'd like to suggest not filming anything longer than 1 or 2 minutes and having a nice mixture of places , faces and events .
First of all , on the ticket it says that the actor was Danny Brook and really he was not .
Then , on the ticket it says that the show starts at 19.30 and , I do n't know why , it started at 20:15 , very impolite on your part , and , also , you wasted my time .
The other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when I asked about it , there were none .
I thought you were a good theatre , where people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else , but really I am very disappointed and I want to ask for my money back .
I 'll never return because of the bad service you offer .
Truly .
Considering my whole life I can say that modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways .
It has , in some way , separated the family , making all of us worried about our own things .
We all work separately , developing individually and forgetting we have to all talk together to know about each other 's life .
First of all , we went to the theatre to pick up our tickets .
We sat in our seats and waited for the show but it did n't start on time , it started at 20.15 which was a ridiculous time .
They are just wasting time on it .
Both of them I am not as good as you expect , but recently I have been interested in them .
However , we decided to have the job , because of good money .
However , it was a great job . I haven't hade such a great experience before .
I was very disappointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true .
I think it will be a very good experience for me . I 'm really excited about it .
I 'd love to come earlier , but I really ca n't because this job is very important to me , and I 'll need it as work experience for my further studies at University .
I would also appreciate it if you would offer me accommodation in a log cabin , because of some health problems that I have , which do not allow me to sleep outside on the ground , and to be honest with you , I never liked camping .
At the end I feel very tired and angry , because I have spent the whole morning doing nothing , except for looking at them trying on different clothes , and that 's not enjoyable at all , in fact it 's really annoying .
To let you arrange the details of your programme , I 'm going to give you my answers .
Firstly , I 'd like to travel in July because I 've already registered on another summer course which starts at the end of July .
About accommodation , I prefer tents to log cabins .
Actually I 've been in an amateur photographer 's organization for 3 years .
At that time , I took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strokes .
And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation .
Concerning the accommodation , I prefer to stay in log cabins , finding them much more comfortable than tents !
Last week during my holiday in London , I found your advertisement in my newspaper .
You stated in your advertisement that he would come on stage , but instead of him someone else turned up .
Luckily I could keep my secret for a couple of days but then it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to .
I 'm looking forward to learning how to take care of myself in dangerous situations , such as getting lost in a forest , and I think staying in a tent will be very useful for that .
This is something I will never ever forget .
I could n't believe that I had met that superstar who was dancing in front of a crowded soccer stadium .
Unfortunately my feelings are rather bad .
The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I decided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show .
The ' theatre ' did not even apologize for this change .
Despite my being a student and the advertisement saying that discounts were available , I was refused a half - price ticket , and the explanation ' why ' was n't sufficient .
Unfortunately it was not , which made me even angrier .
Saturday morning I went to the driving centre for my first lesson .
The instructor opened the car door and asked me to sit in the driver 's seat .
Then I drove very slowly very often crossing the white line on the road .
I looked in the mirror and I saw how my friends were laughing .
Pat apologized to me for not keeping my secrets .
An admirer
I am writing to inform you about the differences between your advertisement and the real show .
Then , as we were told that the show was beginning , the second shock of the evening faced us .
Maria spent all day thinking about who told them that . There were two possibilities : one , her best friend Becca , or her sister Pat .
Obviously , Pat first denied it , but then she accepted that she was wrong , and apologised to Maria . After that Pat never again talked about anyone without his or her permission .
It is your decision .
I would like to send you some further information which you need .
I am grateful that I have the chance to choose the accommodation . I would rather stay in a tent if it 's not a problem for you .
I would like to experience a real camp again .
I would like to thank you once again for this great opportunity .
We would like to believe that shopping is the most wonderful part of our life .
When we finally do this , we can not be comfortable because of the crowds .
The answer is that we choose the same street ( usually the most popular ) and the same time as six hundred other people .
I am writing to you to give you my opinion about your festival .
To conclude , I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at a reasonable price , because for someone who does not especially like art , it was very attractive .
I am writing to you to answer your question about school rules and what I am ( and I am not ) allowed to do at home .
In my home , the only things I am not allowed to do are things which might disturb my family .
For example , putting the music on too loud when my sister is working .
I believe that it was a great idea to organise such a festival , connected with art and culture .
What is more , there was a wide variety of music . Although the artists were supposed to be from all countries , there were only six nationalities .
However I was really surprised that the entrance fee was so low .
I hope that this will clarify your questions and doubts .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
I am writing this letter because I am very disappointed with your musical show .
When we arrived , there were a lot of people , the place was beautiful , all seemed perfect .
After that they changed the principal actor , the one that replaced him was very bad , that made us really angry .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ? I think that technology has changed my life and everybody 's life in many ways .
Nowadays , technology is everywhere , all over your house , your school , office or any place you can be in a city .
This technology has helped to make my life easier and more exciting , but like everything it has had some negative aspects .
This technology has helped in many fields , like medicine , entertainment , work and other things , so it has obviously changed the lives of many people .
The bad consequences that this could have are unimportant , in comparison with all the good things it has done , so let 's not focus on the negative aspects of it .
This is a new era , an era for a new type of people , the future people
Secondly the time on the leaflet is totally wrong .
Thirdly the ticket was not discount and after the show I visited the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the show started late .
Finally last night was not a perfect evening .
But when I hear the word future , I have an image of metallic colours so that in my imagination they are wearing metallic or brightly coloured clothes .
I think people will wear clothes which are metallic or bright colourful colour with mixture of history and future fashion style in the future .
Firstly , I must say that I 'll be able to have two weeks free only in July , since I have started work and am entitled to have a holiday only in July .
Despite my appreciation of all kinds of sports and activities , I 've chosen my favourite ones , which are swimming and tennis .
Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assistants try to sell any product to the " victim " coming through the door .
Our department , which is the sales department , have to make good sales results before the end of June because of the financial month .
About accommodation , I prefer to stay in log cabins because I do n't like to stay in tents which are uncomfortable for me .
In Japan , I often play Golf but as you know Japanese weather conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing Golf , but California has good weather , which means sunshine every day , hopefully .
I am interested in playing tennis very much .
Finally , I have some questions .
So , my temporary job was sound engineer but I was not main engineer .
When I was a university student , I studied sound effects , but I had n't used effect equipment my whole life because our school does n't have it .
I used this equipment during the concert , but I was so complicated system .
They taught me specially .
Take care of yourself .
Hello ! I am very pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition and I want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your Camp in July because that month I usually have a rest and now I am thinking about it .
To answer our first question about where I would prefer to sleep , I prefer tents because they are closer to nature and I like sleeping in sleeping bags ( = BV bags ) .
Now let me tell you about my sports preferences .
Yours sincerely
In our school we have a system of " double lessons " .
It means that every day except Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for an hour and a half and it means a " double lesson " .
I think that is more convenient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts forty - five minutes .
It is convenient , I mean " double " lessons , because you have more time to understand the material which is given out and because you have to prepare only four subjects for " tomorrow " and it is fewer then seven subjects .
On Tuesday we have these lessons : English , Maths , Economics and Physics .
Not only these subjects are studied by us , but also Latin , Russian , Ukrainian , Biology and Physical training , but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects .
I have always been interested in arts and festivals .
It was great that you organised the Arts Festival in this city , because people really need this kind of social activity here .
I spent two days at the International Arts Festival with some of my friends and I must say we were really delighted , it was a great idea to do that in London .
I hope you will consider my opinions and that my suggestions will be helpful for next year .
When I grow up I 'll change all the rules in my life and I 'll make my own rules which are not going to be too strict .
( It is a graduate engineering school where we are studying mechanics and energetics . )
That is why we have to single out which lessons and other activities should be filmed .
Secondly , we should interview the teacher of heat transfer since his lessons are really breathtaking .
On the other hand , we should be interested in the other activities such as sports , which could appeal to more students in our school .
To make matters worse , we have never had the opportunity to see Danny Brook because , instead , there was a different actor !
You wrote so persuasively that it would be our " Perfect Evening Out " ...
I hope you will agree and share my disappointment .
Sincerely yours ,
In fact , winters will be rare or will maybe even disappear .
The ice will melt , the weather will be warmer .
People wo n't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic , because there wo n't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze .
Our feelings will be transmitted electronically through our clothes to other people .
" The Internet on our body " .. I 'm sure that is not impossible !
I am writing to you with a request for a change in the schedule of our trip to London .
Unfortunately I have to suggest a change for the programme for Tuesday the 14th of March .
All of the students - including myself - think of this as a great opportunity that it would be a pity to miss , especially when students can enter for free .
I 've always wanted to taste the freedom that birds have , always been interested in listening to my blood pumping in my veins , full of adrenaline , to let myself free , to shake from excitement .
The home of the future will be very impersonal and the atmosphere will be cold and very essential .
I think this tendency will become more common in the future .
What is important is not their fashion but their knowledge , attitude to everything including fashion .
I apologise For any inconvenience and I am waiting for your reply .
Last week I received your letter in which you told me that I won first prize .
I am writing in response to it .
Please , when you receive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything .
We are going to make a video about daily life at school . The following classes are the ones I recommend filming .
ENGLISH : the classroom is beautiful , and on the same day we do a lot of different activities , so it wo n't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there .
Those three classes are my choices . I hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school .
Finally , I would like to ask you for £ 20 back as I was not satisfied with your services .
But Pat could not resist the temptation to call the police .
I am not used to sleeping in a tent and I think it might ruin my holiday . I hope it 's possible to sleep in a log cabin but if it 's not , you can also put me in a tent .
Surfing is my passion . I live near a beach and whenever I have the time I grab my board and go surfing .
I am really looking forward to this holiday .
The real thing was that I had to look after them because without me they would have been lost .
The thing I really liked was helping the artists and talking to them .
I really got to know them after the concert .
Maybe next time you can come with me . That would be a lot of fun .
Finally , I did n't understand why you pushed people to visit your restaurant if you do n't open it after the show !
If I want to discuss something with friends or order a Pizza , I can do it as easily as I want , when I want .
A good example is the cellular phone . I can contact my family without any problem , I can inform my company if I have an accident in my car .
To sum up , although I think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the world of fame , they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights .
An actor was changed and the public were not informed .
Finally , the theatre restaurant was closed for the holiday !
I think modern technology is very important in my life .
I also think I am lucky , because I live in a period of technological boom .
In the last fifty years human technologies have grown exponentially .
First the conquest of space , then computers , and now the new biotechnologies have changed , and are changing , the face of the world .
In the present day , for example , a lot of people have a personal computer at home , and a very large proportion of those also have the Internet , the new frontier of computer evolution .
If I look back to the past I find that the computer is following the same route as television , the telephone and a lot of other things that now the largest part of the population have at home .
So , in my opinion , new technology has changed , is changing and will change my daily life ; I hope that afterwards my life will be better .
The whole class and I would like to thank you for the good programme which you have organised for our trip to London .
The reason why I 'm writing to you is the class and I have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday , March 14 from 10.00 am - 7.00 p.m.
We all are interested in fashion and hairstyles and it is a great opportunity for us because students do not have to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour .
I would like to suggest to you how the programme could be changed .
Instead of a shopping tour on Tuesday afternoon , we could go to the show and do the shopping on Wednesday afternoon in our free time .
What do you think about this suggestion ?
I hope you will understand this kind of matter . The class and I are looking forward to hearing from you .
That means for example , while you are sitting in the office you are able to control your home with the computer . You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off .
Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk , eggs or cheese .
Or , without leaving the office , you are able to heat the water for a hot bath .
So in fact people 's homes will become more convenient and more comfortable .
I think also housewives will receive more help with a robot in the home .
As representative of my class may I kindly ask you to partially change your plan for our visit to London ?
It would be beautiful if you would agree to change your plan .
It happened on a very lovely day in summer .
I knew I could n't swim so I realized it might be dangerous for me as well .
The most important thing was a little boy of about ten years old , who was in the water without his parents and could n't swim .
It was difficult for me because I am afraid of water .
He was exhausted and could n't breathe .
I am a good swimmer and I have some experience in photography . However , I have a lot to learn .
Actually , the price of the weekend ticket was excellent ! I , myself , was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificent events .
Well , I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate you on the great success of the festival .
I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an allergy to grass .
If you have to go shopping again , because the fridge is empty or you need some new clothes , a lot of time , patience and strength are needed .
So even if it 's nice to have food or new clothes at home , without patience , time and strength you had better stay at home or try to find the most convenient time for shopping .
2 December , 2000
I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added to next year 's International Arts Festival , which in my opinion has been a great idea .
Although I read that stars and artists came from around the world , I realised that they only came from six countries .
All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much , but I personally think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films .
The rest of the activities were very interesting for us , we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people , and all of this without being expensive . I think that the ticket was excellent for us because of its price .
You know that I 'm studying in a difficult school , and as you can imagine you have to work hard and you have to do homework every day .
I have friends that are studying in other schools and they are very happy with their freedom .
It is true , they deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time , however this publicity brings them money , and a comfortable life .
They can travel around the world , buy everything , it is a good life , but at the same time , they must be very good people , because " Fame " is just for a short time , nothing lasts forever in this world .
I would not really like to be a famous person , because you are not really yourself , and for me that is the most important thing .
The first thing that disappointed me was the star .
but the restaurant was closed because the show started at 20:15 and finished at 00.15 and the restaurant was open until 00.00 .
After all these problems I became disappointed .
If you could give me some of my money back that would be a great apology for the waste of time and my disappointment .
It was about Marine , who was our close friend .
Marine 's real father wanted her back but the other couple did n't want to give her back because they loved Marine so much .
The couple could n't tell the truth to Marine because they were afraid of losing her .
I was grateful to hear I have won first prize in the competition .
That 's why I 'd like to feel adventurous .
And according to the interviews , the most interesting class is the " upper intermediate " class .
The point of " upper intermediate class " .
Yesterday morning , I went to the toilet . I overheard two people talking about my son . I felt sorry for myself and I burst into tears . I quickly got out of the toilet .
" Dear " manager of the Circle theatre ,
I was getting angry , but , finally , the show started and I became quieter .
In the end , I asked for I money back ( and payment for my horrible night ) : do you think anybody will give me something back ? !
Science and technology characterize our modern society .
Walking on a city street , it 's difficult to find parks or " green " places with trees and clean air : actually pollution , traffic and noise are the main problems of our society .
I know I 'm a " daughter of this technological world " and unluckily I think I could n't live without it : it 's rather strange that today there 's still somebody without a phone , dishwasher , TV ... But , sometimes I ask myself if the " ancient world " , without science , technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one .
It sounds very promising .
I could feel every movement which was caused by clouds or wind .
I 'm pleased to win the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I 'd like a log cabin for my accommodation , because it 's safer and cleaner than a tent and I would n't share it with anyone .
We can analyze when shopping is enjoyable , and when it is not .
Buying coffins and graveyard plots to bury relatives is not as enjoyable as buying clothes .
The rules in Poland are quite similar to those described in your letter .
I 'm a student from St. Petersburg , and I 'm studying in a drama academy .
My friend & came to London for an excursion .
Danny Brook is my favourite actor & to see him was my dream since my childhood !
It was a surprise when we were told there would be another actor .
Also , we expected to get a discount as students , but international students cards are not valid in your theatre ( that is very strange - even your advertisement has information about discounts ) .
So we were late for our supper in the hotel and the theatre restaurant was also closed without any reasons given .
In the advertisement it said , , your perfect evening out ! " , but it was n't .
I 'm waiting for your answer and hope I can get my money back !
I would call our days days of great technological progress .
Industrial wheel going faster and faster .
They have more different functions and forms .
It is very interesting for me how new works , their possibilities .
My job , I think is a good way to get a profession in the future .
And I hope to find a really good job in a good company .
More and more people buy mobile phones , because they are very useful , you get a lot of possibilities like : using the Internet , buying different goods , booking tickets , controlling your home technic and many others .
Mobile communication is a key to success in all professions that we have !
And I think that I made the right choice of profession - it is the perfect combination : a very progressive form of modern technology , and the most important thing - it is extremely interesting to me !
Regarding the accommodation at the camp , I would prefer the tents , because it is something different which you do n't do every day !
Finally I 've got a question : What clothes must I bring with me and how much money ?
yours faithfully ,
Another thing that makes you furious is when you see a great shirt in a shop and somebody else takes it away or buys it before you can react .
At that time I was lucky and also , I would like to recommend it to other friends .
But people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there are n't convenient appliances in their houses yet .
I 'm writing to you to explain the problem that I have had in your theatre .
I recently had a week 's holiday in London , and , during my stay , I went to your theatre to see " Over the Rainbow " because I had seen an advertisement for this show and I was really interested in seeing it for many reasons , one of the reasons is that I love the star , Danny Brook .
Secondly , in your advertisement the time of the show was 19:30 and in reality the show started at 20:15 and the discount was not available .
I think you can do a lot more things now than before with technology .
best regards .
There are many ways to earn money , especially in a big city , like the one where we are studying all year around .
To be more technical and specific , we need a very flexible job , which gives us independence and allows us to stop working when we are not able to , for example during the exams period .
As a result I asked my acquaintance to come with me to the show .
By the time he got out of the building , the cops were everywhere but as long as Mallory is alive , he wo n't be arrested , with his unpredictable mind .
Secondly , we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to take a seat and the show finally began at 8:15 !
At that time , I used to buy a lottery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts .
One day , while I was checking my weekly ticket , I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substantial amount of money .
I had to wait ten days before the lottery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won .
But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and I found out that I had many unsuspected friends ... Not long after , they were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them ; some proposed going shopping , others going to the cinema and a restaurant .
Finally the end of the week came and I went to the lottery office to find out the amount I had won .
With this letter I would like to ask you if you would change it because we saw in the London Advertiser an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
The show is on Tuesday , March 14th , from 10.00 - 19.00 in the Central Exhibition Hall .
Yours sincerely ,
I knew that my brother was at home , although I did n't know where he was .
In fact when I do n't feel very happy I decide to go shopping to try to cheer myself up .
It is at this moment when really I realise I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling .
Another thing is my accommodation . I prefer to have log cabins because it 's easiest for me .
And how much money I should take ?
If you have children , you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something they want to have , they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them , sometimes they even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying .
Anyway , in families they usually have this problem that when they buy a new one , suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children .
Eventually I like shopping too and I believe everybody likes shopping , but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough money to survive .
Secondly , my choice is the accommodation in tents . I think it could be more interesting . I could enjoy my time with other people playing , eating and talking outside . In my opinion if I choose the log cabin it will be like being at home .
My other choice is painting . I have been painting since I was ten years old . I used to go to special classes and I do n't mind if you need me to help in the class .
The most popular " sport " that everyone does is obviously shopping .
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression . You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have , buying clothes , jewellery , furniture , etc .
But other people do n't think like this . For example , there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost .
The mother was shocked . She did n't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going in and out the places . It was a nightmare but fortunately the police found her .
Can you imagine being in Japan or China and having to go to the shops ?
I do n't think that I 'd enjoy it , all the people kicking you , you ca n't walk properly or buy anything . And also there are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops . I mean that some people can fight to get something .
Dear MANAGER of the theatre
So try to imagine my situation . I had paid a lot of money and I did n't see a good show . I am really disappointed .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Many years ago , more or less seventy years ago a young man , with an excellent capacity for thinking and inventing things , started building a big thing called a " time machine " .
The only thing Pat had to do was to choose a date , one he liked , and to press the starter button , and you know what ? He did it !
I am very happy to hear from you that I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. and I am writing to tell you my information .
Firstly , I will be able to travel only in July because I go to university and I normally spend most of the time working . to do . and I have holiday only in July .
And I choose photography and tennis from the activities list .
I am taking photography lessons at university and I started tennis when I was 10 so I am good at both of them .
From the 10 options that I have to choose from I will choose two , climbing , which I have been doing for three years because I know it by heart , and swimming which I have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal .
I hope that coming after July wo n't disturb Camp California 's plans for me .
A survey has been done , and the issue is which subjects ( lessons ) and activities the students think are the most enjoyable .
Someone says it is maths - practical , useful - but the majority say it is boring , unless you 're choosing a job which demands all your maths knowledge such as accounting , otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer .
The majority have chosen History , which means a big journey around the world , either at the Roman life style , or in the middle ages , when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands .
At all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed . This is an important part of our life , which is full of emotions in development .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
Sometimes , I think I am a computer addict because whenever I come back home , my hand goes to the computer switch , automatically , even though I do n't want to use the computer .
I received a paper in which I was told about a play you are putting on and of the advantages I would get if I went to see it . I wish that had never happened .
I am really disappointed , and I want to have my money back .
First of all , on the sheet I received , it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actors . That is not true , because instead of him , there was another actor , and I do n't know what his name is .
You must understand that you promised me I 'd have a good evening and I really did n't .
I write this letter to tell you about the programme that starts tomorrow , about that excellent book I have told you to read .
This excellent book tells the story of a man of 25 years that has a little boy , his son , that lives in a very bad condition .
The book is very easy to read , but if you do n't have time I recommend listening to the programme .
Also , that they will invite a psychologist , the author of the book and maybe the president will talk so I recommend you listen to it .
I might say that I am really good at swimming and sailing because I have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and I have had a really good training in water sports .
As you know , I 'd never been to any activities as a volunteer before .
The concert tickets were very expensive and I 'd seen an advertisement on TV .
It said , " Be a volunteer at our concert and get a free ticket . "
We have bought some snacks to eat and three students will sing for him , too .
I 've just received your letter , and I must say that I am so surprised . I was n't expecting to win it .
I am still studying at the moment I will finish at the end of June so I will be able to leave at the beginning of July .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent so as to get a better rest . I have a problem sleeping and a log cabin will be more peaceful than a tent .
It 's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot , which are climbing , tennis , surfing and photography , but if I have to make a choice , I choose climbing and surfing .
I 'm rather experienced at climbing . I have done it once a month since I was 17 .
But on the other hand , I have never been surfing . I am a complete beginner but I am dying to do it .
A good idea to start will be an alarm clock ringing close to his bed , because that 's the way everyone gets up in the morning ( apart from the people who do n't do anything ) .
After this introduction , it will be time to show some of the activities everyone can do at the school , such as lessons or others like the library , our protagonist having a coffee with some colleagues in the cafe bar , the reception service .
First of all , the most favourable time for me to travel is July , because I am in the final year of University , so I have to attend classes for a thesis almost throughout the year apart from July , when I can take a relatively long summer holiday .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in log cabins to staying in tents , since I have had a horrible experience being attacked by a swarm of midges , when I camped out .
This is based on a questionnaire conducted in the school and our English department 's investigation .
According to statistics based on the questionnaire , the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class .
In fact , I visited some English classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers .
Consequently , it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atmosphere may be able to be filmed .
The girls ' football team is also famous for its reputation of keenness on practice .
Actually , I can work with it in my office and visit some website using the new technologies such as the Internet .
The new inventions have transformed my life , so it is easier with modern technology ( the mobile , the car , the plane , the coach , the train , the medical advances and domestic appliances ) , they have created more comfort and pleasure .
In fact , I expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffered . I trust you will give immediate attention to this letter and I look forward to receiving a satisfactory response by return of post within a week .
When we think about clothes in the future , we should think about the environment first .
Of course , technology will have developed enough for us to invent new material for those kinds of clothes .
So we do n't have to worry about how heavy they will be .
Firstly , I expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but I felt very angry when I saw different actors .
What is more , you advertised there were discounts available but there were not .
You said that the musical show started at 19.30 but recently it began at 20.15 .
When I was 16 years old I fell in love with the most handsome boy in our school .
Everybody started to laugh at me .
I 'm sorry to tell you that I 'm really disappointed with your advertisement for the musical show at the Circle Theatre .
And because of these circumstances , I would like to have a part of my money back .
Faithfully ,
He said , ' Sure , no problem ' .
As to accommodation I would like to choose a tent because I am used to travelling with my sleeping bag and my tent all over Europe .
I am very good at basketball , and even if I am not a tall boy , I am a good player and I play in a local team .
I connected wires , I carried loudspeakers , and so on .
Towards the end of the concert I handed a bottle of wine to Poolo Conte .
As you know he 's my favourite singer .
Secondly , the two activities which I 'd like to do during the camp are sailing and surfing .
When you go to a shop it is difficult to find what you are looking for without the help of the shop assistant .
After that you have to wait a long time in the queue to pay and many times it is n't possible to pay with your credit card and you do n't have any money in cash .
You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , whose music is my favourite , but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of .
When they finished singing the last song I was surprised when they called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people .
I am not good at either of them .
I haven't written a letter to you for ages .
I did n't need to pay an entrance fee because I was working there .
Plus , I got an autograph from a popular singer . I 'll give you the autograph as a present .
It is valuable of keeping on your souvenir .
I would offer you one suggestion that concerns the classical concerts .
For me , it 's very stressful and I usually run a lot to do it .
In response to your letter that I received last Saturday I am writing to answer your questions .
I usually sing in my spare time and my friends love it when I sing and regarding swimming I was champion last year in my city .
Are tablets necessary ( for headache , insects ) ?
It is wonderful how technology makes things so easy .
That will be great because teachers are part of our life and they have to receive all our attention and friendship because if it was n't for them we would never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidently and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget .
The reasonably - priced package , including tickets and accommodation , well suited my personal situation : comfortable rooms that are easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide at the last minute .
- improve your kindness and ask for work in restaurants or bars . It is a good training period for real life too ( being patient with demanding people is required ) .
- check your wallet and if you have enough money ( a very small amount ) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Chile , Cuba , Zambia , and Morocco where people ( poorer than you ) will offer low wages for ôsmallö jobs .. you might enjoy your summer holidays and ôfind yourselfö
I am keen on singing and I have won several singing competitions at school .
When I first entered the concert hall , I was given a pass for working here .
The programme is very exciting and interesting , especially the river trip to Greenwich .
This is the arrangement that we founded with the other students and everyone agreed .
We had n't enough money to buy food or new clothes and the worst was that my youngest brother was terribly ill , and without money we could n't take him to a doctor .
I want to travel only in July because now I 'm studying at National Academy of Defense and I do n't have time for anything else .
I prefer that because I will travel with my wife and she always prefers that kind of accommodation .
I tell you in secret that I do n't know why she does that .
I like to catch fish too .
My personal best is 27.66 for fifty meters . I would like to ask you about the weather in California in July .
Are there any discotheques or something ? I would like to know if my wife can come with me , because without her I ca n't be there .
Everybody gets up at six , and the first thing they do is run for about two thousand five hundred metres .
Then they take a shower and everybody goes for breakfast .
Two times a week I have W - F. This is very important , because every soldier should be strong .
After this competition there was mathematics , and two hours of biology .
I do n't like biology , so I slept on the desk in a classroom .
I think that competitions should be filmed because my school is a kind of sports school .
On video there should be how we get up .
Houe we run , how we eat breakfast .
Then you should show how our school looks from outside .
There should be an interview with students and with professors .
Daily life at my school is not only school and teachers and mathematics problems .
We must know how to use a gun , or how to drive a tank .
And , finally , right before the start they announced that Danny Brook would not be in the show that evening .
After the show I was not surprised at all to learn that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration .
Undoubtedly , modern technology has changed my daily life .
And the best word I can use to describe all the changes is " drastic " .
Among the greatest inventions of man I come across daily are the telephone , computer and automobile .
The computer , probably the must versatile invention , allows me to get access to huge informational sources through the Internet , to do shopping without leaving my house , to do my work more effectively and quickly .
People used to wear very different things from the clothes we wear now , we would n't even say that they are ' clothes ' .
The things that people wear are changing all the time , everyone tries to be different in public and very different sorts of clothes are being created .
I believe they will wear very different things .
By contrast , in the future , I guess we would rather go back to the ancient time , owing to have natural life style . We will be unwilling to give housework away .
They are more comfortable and really match with the environment .
Although this is a new experience , I would prefer climbing and photography .
The concert was a big success , a lot of excitement .
The students mentioned that it would be very interesting to show the English lesson because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to find out about our English course .
Additionally , the advertisement said I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I told Pat everything even my secrets when we were still friendly .
However , we are not friends anymore because of a secret in the past .
I told Pat that my father and mother were going to separate .
Maybe it was the wrong decision to tell her . She began to share that secret with everybody , including the teachers .
Finally , I decided to go to another school and I will not tell any secret to anyone .
To begin with , in your letter you asked me when I would like to travel .
Thanking you in advance for your help , I look forward to hearing from you .
Also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes there are planned visits to historical places .
In this lesson you can learn how to speak , write and read this foreign language with teachers that are well prepared .
theatre
To sum up , it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting lessons and some optional activities to do in your free time .
Regarding accommodation at Camp California , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is safer than a tent .
Now , my English teacher has asked me to explain what I think .
In my opinion , nowadays , shopping is very easy and at the same time very hard .
Amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time : shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains .
About the activities that I can do at the camp , I chose to play Basketball , which is my favourite sport , because I want to do some exercise while I am on vacation .
I also chose photography because it is one of my hobbies .
I 'm writing you a letter , because you are the organiser of an International Arts Festival .
There is only one bad thing , that this festival was too short .
I 've just received this letter from you , so I 'm writing to you .
On Saturday and Sunday we do n't have lessons , but it does n't seem that we do n't have work .
I do n't have trouble with my education . My friends and teachers are nice and friendly , but there is one thing I 'd like to change in my school .
I 'd like to have more tests during the whole course , not only at the end , because it 's making me very lazy .
Apart from that , the show was delayed forty - five minutes , consequently , everybody there lost control and became angry .
Finally I would like to inform you that I have never had such an unpleasant evening in my whole life .
The worst was that he did it unconsciously .
Later , I realised it was the worst thing that could happen to me .
I 'm writing to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held a few days ago .
For example , there were some concert halls which were too small to hold so many people , the stars and artists were just from six countries , which is not enough for the audience .
This reminds me of what I experienced during my teenage years .
We believe that the programme is very good and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time especially for that .
The exhibition is called the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it takes place at the Central Exhibition hall , in London , From 10.00 till 19.00 .
The class is very excited about that because the Show covers the latest Fashions , leisure and Sports Wear , make - up and hairstyles .
Of course if you are in the public eye , the reasons why you want privacy are different , because if you are a politician , for example , you fear for your life .
Because
As for accommodation I would prefer to stay in tents .
It is amazing and sometimes amusing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is .
But I do feel ill at ease when I see disappointed or angry assistants ' faces on leaving the magic world without any souvenirs of it !
I do apologize about that .
If this is an inconvenience , please feel free to tell me .
Guess what I 've done !
The preparation days came .
I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amazing !
In particular , going to the Museum and the Art Gallery will be a great opportunity for all of us , as they are world - famous places in London .
It was okay , because I was quite good at that , but the problem was that I had to jump onto the roof !
Another point which I think was annoying was the concert hall .
Yours sincerely
Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunately the school that I 'm going to is like a military camp .
My family allows me almost everything except smoking and drinking alcohol of course , which I do n't do anyway .
So if it 's possible could you arrange it for me please .
And also , I would prefer the log cabins to the tents , as I have never slept in a sleeping bag before .
All of her fans were stood up the whole concert and dancing .
Some of the fans were not good at all because they shouted and argued , but most of the people were very good .
I must say though , I would have to travel in July because it 's the summer holidays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible .
A log cabin would be the ideal accommodation . Presumably they are more spacious than tents and it would be easier to keep tidy .
I would like to know how much money people usually take and how much clothing .
I know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help , but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected .
Thirdly , I would prefer to swim and play tennis , because I have been doing this since I was I child , and I think I am very good at each activity .
A few minutes later the show started and the group appeared on the stage .
Later , when the show had finished , I stayed with the group in their room for a few minutes .
What I really liked doing was helping them with their clothes and make - up , because I learnt how to do make - up for someone and I spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world .
Regarding starting time and the theatre restaurant , to see the musical I had to wait about 45 minutes because it started at 20:15 .
I know you are always interested in detective stories , especially Agatha Christie 's . Do n't be surprised !
Where the stories are concerned , they will not be difficult to understand because you already know the stories and the narators are going to read clearly .
Regarding the accommodation , I would be pleased to stay in a tent , because this reminds me of my holidays with my family .
I just had to take care of them , serving some drinks and food during the rehearsals .
I write to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I had a very disappointing evening because of many things .
First the actor was a very average actor .
Also in the advertisement they talk about discount tickets .
Well they did n't accept my £ 20 discount ticket . Why ?
And finally I could n't visit the theatre restaurant after the show , it was closed . Why ?
Also I wanted to tell you that the show was very boring .
It was always the same .
Because of all these things it obviously was n't the perfect evening as was said in the advertisement .
I had to explain to everybody that I actually did n't have a girlfriend . I explained to them that it was a good possibility , nothing else , but no one believed me , because Pat had told them that I had an actual girlfriend .
This problem with Pat had a lot of consequences , because I had a very heavy discussion with her about it . It was so heavy that one of our teachers had to calm me down , because I was very angry with her .
Regarding the accommodation , if possible I would like to stay in a tent because I think it is a relaxing place to stay .
And if during the nights there are any entertainments ?
The opposite situation is when I pass my exams and I really need to buy something as a present for myself .
It is really interesting .
That is the second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning and lasts until 19.00 .
This technological improvement is changing people 's lives , behaviour , even their homes .
But we ca n't stop these technological improvements .
We should use them in positive ways .
and we are practising these things .
In the future life will be more artificial than it was .
How delighted I was when I received your letter !
I would like to ask you how much money I need , how the weather is , in order to pack the necessary clothing , and whether I need anything else .
I am sending you some pictures , the best ones only because there were some quite embarrassing ones .
It was n't a spokesperson Kim but just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage .
You did n't tell us any details about how much the ticket costs to go inside .
In my class room somary people stay outside London about 50% in my class room and everyone is very worried about how they can stay for three days in London .
And we 're very excited about your programme .
Because in London there are a lot of shopping places , can you tell us about shopping and the time For spend or day ?
Thank you For any detail more I think we go with you and enjoy a fantastic programme .
If I tell something in the college baby someone like or dislike about my story but I think my story it very good for someone .

A simple and well - proven architecture .
Every electronic gadget in the future home will be able to communicate with other machines or computers .
Regarding the accommodation at the camp , I would prefer a tent . The reason is that I like to live really naturally and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent than in a cabin .
It was marvellous .
It was hard work for a while but I was so happy to help at a really big pop concert I ca n't describe it .
I really enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest , if not the greatest experience of my life .
The organizer of the tour spoke with me and asked me if I wanted to do the same work in two months at the Rolling Stones concert Is n't that fantastic !
That 's the most suitable accommodation for a camping holiday .
They also gave me a ticket to watch the concert live .
I was really happy to be seeing the " Best Musical Show " in London .
By problems I mean that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts available ?
The most disappointing thing was that there were different actors to those advertised who were not very good at acting .
It was n't really a perfect evening as you promised on your flyer .
I was very disappointed and I would like to have my money back .
If you think about the early days , when no cars were on the roads and no one had an opportunity to fly to another country for a holiday , people had to walk or go by horse and ship .
Today , everyone has the opportunity to just get into a car and drive wherever they want to .
This is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing their jobs .
Another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because they watch TV or play or work on the Computer and do n't see each other anymore because they do n't have to .
We can hardly imagine life without computers , TV sets , microwaves , and so many other things , and yet none of these things existed seventy years ago .
Her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help their child and that is the reason why I 'm writing this story .
I have received your letter concerning two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
Regarding my accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin because it 's more comfortable than a tent and less hot with the sun .
However , I hope , there is water and light inside this log cabin .
The saleswomen are too busy and haven't a moment to give you advice .
The other one is tennis , which is also my favourite sport and I have been playing for several years .
Lastly , I would like to know how many people are coming to the Camp I will go to .
I should be grateful if you would send me the further information that I asked for and I look forward to hearing from you soon .

I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see : It is " The London Fashion and Leisure Show " , which is going to take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London , on Tuesday the 14th March , between 10.00 and 19.00 .
I 'm very pleased to receive this prize .
Other workers are taking on other months so there is only July that is available for me .
I 'm very good at tennis , and I was a professional tennis player .
Unforgivably , my climbing skill is nothing like my tennis skill , but I always love climbing .
I 'm afraid of heights and I have always wanted to conquer that fear !
Filming life at school means filming the students ' actions and behaviour .
It is very interesting and fun with the experiment .
Lots and lots of experiments produce quite interesting and amazing results and I think Science is very useful in life .
Also it is not a very easy subject so we can capture other students ' faces in confusion and puzzlement .
We can see students expressing their feelings , wonderful and exciting story that the student made up or from a well well - known story .
Another exciting subject which most of the students like very much is P.E. Many students like to play sports .
I do a lot of sports , so apart from playing tennis I am a member of our local swimming centre . I can assure you that I am gradually improving my sports skills .
It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4,000 seats for the " spectators " if you can call them that .
The musicians brought it in order to achieve a high standard of sound quality .
I visited your theatre and I was very disappointed for a number of reasons .
I 've read your advertisement and the reality was different to what was written there .
There was no Danny Brook but instead of him there was a different actor and I 'm very disappointed about that because I 'm a fan of his .
There were no discounts available so I overspent .
The theatre restaurant was closed for no reason apparent to me .
It was a really bad evening and because of that could you possibly give me my money back ?
Everything was going perfectly before last month when I met a girl from the other school .
So one day she invited me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illegal .
So I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climbed out of the window .
Next day my best friend went to the headmaster and told him about me so he put me on suspension .
At this we can see the latest fashions , imaginative make - up and hairstyles .
I am sorry to cause you inconvenience .
Last night , when I went into my house it was quite silent .
My father always remembered his responsibility was to provide his workers with a good salary , which is the aim of his life .
When I , with mixed feelings , went home I found my parents were standing at the door looking very cheerful . '
It is a good idea to include the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery in the morning on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively .
Firstly , there will be leisure and sports wear and the latest fashions .
Secondly , there will be exhibitions about makeup and hairstyles .
And on Tuesday we will enjoy the London fashion and Leisure Show till 19.00 .
I am looking forward to receiving your positive reply .
We are interested in politicians ' and film stars ' clothes , hobbies , passions and intrigues .
There are large numbers of journalists following them all the time , even in their private life .
We can go for a walk , go shopping , go to the cinema , get married or divorced .
Why must everybody know and talk about their private life ?
I was not satisfied with the show at all because it was very different from the description your advertisement had given .
It was a disaster and I am going to tell you why .
But it has advantages as well as disadvantages .
On the other hand there are disadvantages , too .
Firstly , the environment is polluted because of technology , although this is our fault .
Secondly for us there are disadvantages because pollution affects us indirectly , and because I do n't do anything but watch television , and it is n't very good at all .
I am writing to complain about your service .
You were meant to start the show at 19.30 p.m. but you started very late at 20.15 p.m without any explanation to the audience .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I knew that but I needed someone who could understand and support me at that moment .
I told her about my pregnancy because she has a friend who works in a hospital as a doctor .
I asked her for help and she promised me she would do everything that she could and keep my secret .
Pat gave me some advice and I decided to have an operation .
I got a bit depressed but my parents supported me .
They stopped me having the operation .
You wo n't wait in the queue .
I am a good swimmer and also good at golf ( handicap twelve ) . I took a certificate to become a teacher in both of them six years ago before I went to " CROARA GOLF " in Milan where I organised the evening 's entertainment for the customers .
First of all , I believe that if someone has time to go to the shops has the possibility .
Do you know I am amazing when it comes to playing tennis ?
Great fun , very happy , if go with your girlfriend it will feel romantic , you should think something like this , but do you know it is not always like this ?
If you interested in the clothes as well , but you need to remember , one is male , but one is female , they should have different fashion , at that moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat , so in the end you both will feel unhappy or angry with each other .
Mr. Manager ,
In this uncomfortable situation I am writing to tell you about some irritating problems .
Then , the time stated as the beginning of the show was 19:30 and unfortunately it began at 20:15 .
Closing these facts , when the musical finished I was very , after waiting for the start of the musical and I was disappointed with this version of Over the Rainbow . Everybody went to the restaurant , which was closed without any explanation .
I am very disappointed with this evening and with this disorganised way of dealing with problems so I am asking for my money back .
They always did things together , and they were the most popular boys in school . Both were very handsome , played football ; they were an example for everybody .
Unable to keep a secret he told everyone , ended his friendship with Ted . Now Ted is rejected by everyone , no one talks to him and Pat is the example , but without his best friend and his honesty .
In accordance with what you have told me about the accommodation I would prefer to go and stay in tents , because I think they 're unusual and that is not something that you do every day .
In my opinion you have to give some money back to me .
She is a very good girl and she can deal with every problem she has .
My name is Agripina T. I just received your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions .
While I 'm at the Camp , I would like to do two of my favourite activities , which are basketball and singing .
In the past I was in a basketball team and I enjoyed it a lot .
At the Camp , is there a free uniform or will we have to wear something special ?
And is it necessary to bring money , will we need it ?
Students think that we do n't do anything and we do n't learn anything special .
Our music lessons are special .
And it 's always interesting to watch others while they do something like that .
You can find further information from me about Camp California in the USA .
First of all I can go to Camp California only in July because I will start working at our local leisure centre as a swimming instructor .
I would like to stay in a log cabin because I have had bad experiences with tents .
We are all customers of the big supermarkets . They have all that we need .
But when we think about it seriously , shopping is not enjoyable , for example , if you forget something that you need for a salad .
You have to go back to the supermarket and find the nearest parking space , then before someone takes the last fresh lemon for your salad , you must find out where the lemon section is , because they love to change the store around again and again .
Firstly , I read in the advertisement that the actor would be Danny Brook , and this is one of the reasons why I went to the theatre .
But I had a big surprise when I saw that it was a different actor , and I was very disappointed .
I was very angry with her . I did n't know what to do , I was afraid that I had lost all my friends .
After a few seconds of thought I went straight to Pat . " Why , why did you do that ? "
Firstly , you advertised that Danny Brook , who is my favourite , is the lead but there was another actor instead of him .
In accordance with study or work , I use the Internet , which is the easiest way to get information from all around the world .
When I asked for the price I was surprised because the assistant told me there was n't any discount available .
After two hours I thought that all of this information was written from a foreign point of view and it was n't the native opinion .
I used my computer to collect reports from the Internet and I can promise I found so much information that I could n't analyse it in two weeks .
Changes wo n't stop coming : the WAP technology ( you 'll buy a cake from a vending machine without any coins , only one call ) , digital TV , virtual reality and more ...
I would prefer to stay in a tent to staying in a cabin . Because it is something I feel more familiar with . I used to go camping with my family every summer .
Sometimes you can stay out all day just to buy a present for someone . It starts in the morning , and of course you have breakfast somewhere , and it gets later and you are still looking for it , so you have lunch , and finally you spend more money than you thought you would .
RECOMMENDATIONS
I have just received your letter informing me that I won a two week holiday at Camp California , so I am writing to you to tell you my preferences for the travel and the accommodation .
About the accommodation , I have no problems , but I would prefer staying in a tent , so that the holiday may be more adventurous .
First of all , the reason why I bought the ticket was Danny Brook , who is my favourite star , and was going to appear in the show .
I could say that we can not survive without them .
It is getting more convenient and useful than our past life .
Furthermore , it is possible to treat many patients who have serious diseases more effectively , if we use modern technology in medical science .
Because of convenience , we can use our time more effectively , but we should not rely on these things too much .
Last week I attended the musical " Over the rainbow " , and I am writing in order to complain about things that really disappointed me .
Hello . I 'm Robert and I 'm writing an article about clothes in the future .
In my opinion , in a hundred years we 'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays .
I received your letter and I 'm very happy because I did n't expect it , so first of all I want you to know that I really fancy going to Camp California in the U.S.A . for two weeks , especially because I 've never been to this country .
Finally I want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp .
I look forward to receiving a reply from you .
We arrived quite early because we had to work out how we were going to serve people did with which order , so we started putting all the stuff in the appropriate place .
I was very nervous because I 'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and I could n't help it and I started crying - you can imagine , they were so handsome that I could n't believe it - I tried to calm down because I had to work , and later I began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream .
I want to know if it is available at that time .
Furthermore , I would like to ask you which kind of clothes I need to take and how much money I 'll spend .
But a lot of inconveniences annoy them .
First of all the parking is not convenient and is expensive .
Sometimes you have to park your car in a further place then walk to the supermarket .
Furthermore , when you look around the supermarket , you ca n't easily find the goods which you want to buy .
It 's very confusing without the right signs .
As I understand , it is very important to confirm the date of my trip .
Now about accommodation . If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a tent .
I am quite good at tennis , especially playing doubles .
Also I like swimming and I 've got two years ' experience of teaching swimming at a leisure centre .
I ca n't concentrate in a shop , and I ca n't relax either .
On the other hand , I understand very well that it is really necessary . I also understand that nobody will do that in my place .
I think it is an opportunity to meet different people ( even if they are pushing you ) , to understand what they like and what they do n't , because even some kinds of food can be in fashion .
I am writing this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening at your musical show " Over the rainbow " at the Circle Theatre where you are the director .
This was a very difficult decision but I had to take it because of my personal situation , all the time shouting and fighting with all my family .
I 'm writing this letter to you to make a complaint about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " which I saw yesterday . I have to say that I 'm very disappointed with what I saw because after seeing your advertisement I expected more . The show was entirely different to what it says in the advertisement .
I was a little more patient so I stayed to watch the whole show , which by the way was the worst I have ever seen .
I do n't know why I paid £ 20 with no discount , which the advertisements said I would have .
Then I thought that I should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that I could n't say that I had wasted my time by coming here .
Computers have entirely changed people 's lives .
There are hundreds of programs which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger who you want to meet .
I wo n't ever forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the truth about my strange disease .
Before it was packed into by the audience , we had to clean around the reception , but totally it was really exciting although I was just a member of staff in the small reception , because I felt great excitement ( especially girls ! ) from people queueing .
I know this is one right love . I 'm absolutely besotted with him .
She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always makes a joke of it . That makes me feel so embarrassed : I was very angry at that time !
Amazingly , we can find that there are more and more computer users .
My daily life has also changed a lot through the use of computers or modern technology .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in and they are n't very cosy .
I would like to ask you for vegetarian food for me as I am a very strict vegan , and to suggest what kind of clothes to bring .
In a nutshell I think Maths , basketball , Speech and Drama , and History should be filmed .
Firstly , I would like to thank you warmly for this great prize .
Of course we will also show other activities , such as PE , the lunch break and the theatre workshop .
It was n't a " perfect evening out " like you said in the advertisement , so my friends and I would be grateful if you would give us some money back , if that is possible .
Your faithfully
It 's a sad story but it lets you know about a type of life that you ca n't imagine really exists .
I would like to travel only in July , because I am going to study at my university until the end of June .
I have a lot of possibilities for spending my spare time .
Generally I paint some landscapes by using watercolours , but sometimes I try to paint like during the impressionist era by using blobs , oil paint and canvases .
In order to prepare it I visited some classrooms during the lessons and I interviewed a number of students from our school .
Some of the teachers are very good professionals .
Their lessons are valuable , rich in knowledge and funny .
According to students ' opinions , the most popular activities are basketball , tennis , swimming and also the photography group and the painting team .
It could make the video more interesting .
It will show that during every day we have great fun and we receive good , important knowledge .
My school starts a summer holiday from 1st July and I am going to take a summer course from August .
They can relax , reduce their stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted .
However , shopping sometimes makes them stressed . People often waste money on worthless things .
During the camp I would like to practise my swimming ( I have attended swimming lessons for 3 years ) and also I would like to learn how to take some good photos .
Sometimes , unfortunately shopping can be very annoying , especially at Christmas or Easter time .
The only advice would be : " Do not do your shopping at Christmas or Easter time " - but it will not make any sense , will it ?
In addition to this , it was not the famous actors that you had mentioned in the advertisement performing , so we were disappointed .
Then I had to wait 45 minutes ; the show started at 20:15 .
At that moment I was really angry , so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant , but it was closed , because of its bad hygiene and food .
Now I only need to push a button , and things or machines work on their own .
Homework is easier to do with the computer than with a book sometimes .
Maybe , I wo n't be able to understand how the things work and that scares me . I will be useless , because a machine will do all the work .
To begin with , it was not Danny Book who acted in the show , as you wrote .
And then about the tickets , you wrote that there were discounts available but there were not .
Finally when we had seen the Musical , we went to the restaurant and it was closed because they were doing some decorating , and you wrote in your advertisement , " Visit our theatre restaurant after the show "
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Clothes are a very interesting subject to study .
If you travel around you can see a lot of difference still between different cultures .
First I think that in the future we are going to wear fewer clothes because the climate is going to get warmer and warmer .
Finally in my opinion I wish we would dress more as we did in the past , using natural material . We must think more about the environment and live closer to nature .
In the past , for example , we used to write letters to communicate , but now we surely send an e - mail , a fax or make a phone call .
Nowadays , you get everything immediately , but will it always be a good thing ? I think not .
So they prefer to leave their sons watching TV .
In my view , it was extremely interesting and satisfying for me all the concert long .
Although I can not explain any more about the thing I felt during the concert in this letter , I 'd like to recommend you to help at a pop concert .
I am afraid that I could n't write to you immediately , but last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and so I was very busy .
Regarding the accommodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin .
I think that the cabins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes .
I chose climbing because I 'm interested in this sport even though I 'm not experienced .
Yours sincerely
Before the concert I helped with carrying and putting in order some chairs on which some special people would sit .
In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and get a lot of autographs by them .
I was doing different activities , from designing fliers to selling tickets .
In addition I checked the e - mail daily and answered the phone .
In the advertisement it said that discounts were available , but when I asked a member of staff in the theatre about the discount he did n't offer me one .
I expect this will be possible .
Like earrings , necklaces , bracelets , rings , glasses , hair bands , handbags , shoes , watches , etc .
We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical " Over the Rainbow " at the " Circle Theatre " .
So when the miserable musical came to its end , we were happy to leave the theatre auditorium , but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant , because no restaurants were open anymore , because it started too late .
Pat was my big brother , who had heard of some people paying , " safety - money " , but never know the reason , until he found a large amount of money in my room .
Yeah folks , that was the point I got interrupted by my parents in this beautiful dream , but if you want to hear the end of my story than buy the " Rossall - School - magazine " , next issue , and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story .
Secondly , for accommodation , I prefer to say in log cabins , as I have no experience staying in a tent , I hesitate to try .
I used to belong to the singing club when I was a high school student and once we won the contest , moreover , painting is one of my favourite hobbies .
Finally , I would like to ask you whether there is anything I should bring on this trip such as specific clothes , extra money etc .
It was a privilege to help at a pop concert .
My dear friend , if I tell you this , I am sure you will get jealous .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I 'd appreciate for giving me the first prize in the competition .
The aim of this report is to summarize the results of the survey , which is about making a short video .
Yet , one extremely hot day while I was peacefully walking by the sea and thinking about my own problems , I discovered my elder brother 's girlfriend with another boy .
So , the next day , I nervously came to Pat 's apartment where she had been living on her own since she was eighteen .
From the activities , I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - and Photography - about which I know just the basic skills .
Besides , it was confirmed by scientists that consumerism may develop into a compulsion .
First of all , I was looking forward to seeing one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook , and it was very disappointing for me to see a different actor instead of him in spite of his name being written in the advertisement .
I 'm writing this letter to inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I visited the Circle Theatre .
It 's something absolutely necessary for every action people perform . It affects us both positively and negatively .
I 'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we 're there .
First of all , we 'd like to thank you for the programme you have already arranged . It 's wonderful because it covers most of our interests .
But also we would like to visit The London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 - 19:00 .
Thank you for your time . We 're looking forward to hearing from you soon .
I had always wanted to travel abroad and experience other people 's lives and cultures , so I decided to go to Paris as soon as I finished university .
But in spite of all of these disadvantages , I was pursuing my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything I was going to do it .
It took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me , so that when they decided to move to London , they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the family , even though it was very hard at the beginning .
First of all , the stars of the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
But your stars were not there .
From every singular things I have complained , it was totally different from what your advertisement said .
And I can send e - mail to my friends via the Internet fast and cheaply compared to the old - style mail - services .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the disappointing experience I had with your theatre .
And last , the most disappointing thing , the advertisement also said that Danny Brook would be there , my favourite actor , but there was someone else instead of him .
So , the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that the advertisement promised .
So , that afternoon at lunchtime , I went into the teachers ' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quietly and calmly .
That was the most scary and daring thing that I did in my childhood .
Sincerely ...
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets and so his whole school knew about Sara 's experience .
Sara was a very good pupil .
She spent the money on a magazine .
I am writing to you to thank you for your very good organisation of the International Arts Festival , where I spent two excellent days recently .
I suggest it would be very interesting to meet artists from faraway and exotic countries .
To finish my letter , I hope that my notes can help you to make next year 's festival more interesting and comfortable for the public .
It is so because you are young and need to make your life as interesting as it can be now .
Naturally , it 's easier to get a job when you are good at foreign languages or computers .
Also some concert halls were too small for this many people .
The school is like a dungeon here .
I do n't want to be so evil about school but rules are rules and they are limiting us within the borders of our school .
We are not allowed to compare our thoughts during the lessons because the teachers think that we are chatting .
I had been looking forward to seeing my favourite actor Danny Brook , but he had been replaced by some other actor .
I was not too happy about that and why did n't the show start when it was supposed to start ?
Your advertisement was full of false advertising .
I hope you appreciate my letter and that you 'll try to amend these problems./ Sally Svenssen
I do n't have to mess around in the supermarket on a Friday evening , when I 'm tired from school , I just get all the groceries I need delivered to my door instead .
Nowadays I spend 2 hours in front of the computer every day , shopping or chatting to people .
The last thing I would like to know is what clothes I have to take , even though the weather in July will be good .
So , let 's imagine that your credit card is not working , or some one stole your cash from your pocket .
Also it is very difficult to shop if you are handicapped .
Staying in a queue or crowd is also unpleasant .
Your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracies ; this show did not start at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15 .
Under these circumstances , as your Theatre did not fulfil its commitments , I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque for £ 15 , as soon as possible Yours faithfully
Mind what you tell her ; she can make the worst of it ; gossiping is her favourite leisure activity !
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me when I was at work ; completely devastated and weeping scalding tears , she could hardly pronounce a word .
I could get her to simmer for a second or two then she suddenly started shouting uncontrollably : - " Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat " , Olga hurled this at me down the phone .
For activities , my first choice is basketball . I have been playing it since I was nine years old .
My second choice is golf .
However , I could enjoy it , even though I was a beginner , so I would like to practise and have fun at the camp .
As I have told you , I had a chance to help at a concert of Majesty , a local band in which one of my friends played guitar .
At first I just helped setting up the stage ; setting microphones , and tuning guitars .
He explained to me that it was to control the light .
It was fun practising how to move the lights and change the lights .
Beside that , I 'm allergic , and that causes me problems when I 'm close to nature .
I 'm quite good at painting and I play tennis . I 'll be very happy if you can give me a chance to use the camp 's art studio and you 'll be able to prepare some painting materials like oil paints , canvas and brushes for me .
I think the result of that action was marvellous .
Everybody was very surprised that you can create such amazing things , using scissors and paper .
The light on the stage was very bright and very warm which made the scenery very pleasant .
The organisers paid for my accommodation and flight to Ireland .
On the next day I helped them to build the scenery and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening .
In order to know what sort of clothes I have to take , please can you tell me about the normal weather for this period ?
One of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes . Our school is now the best in the country in all ages . We are prest with this . We can show what we do in order to be the best .
It would be good to show the swimming pool , the gym , etc .
And on the other hand we also have a very important museum , and a very beautiful building in the school grounds , bowls them ! !
After that , your restaurant was closed without reason .
Introduction : The aim of this report is to summarize the right lessons and activities to be filmed .
Conclusion
I have always been interested in visiting other countries .
Below is a summary of the most important relevant points with some recommendations .
The fully equipped computer centre in the main building is extremely good .
2 . The school arranges an amazing range of activities , such as excursions , sports and different kinds of trips .
Regarding accommodation , between tents and log cabins , I would prefer a tent , because I love adventure and also because I can be freer .
I know I will have the chance to do two activities , so I have chosen two from your list : basketball , because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been part of a strong team for three years .
The other one I have chosen is swimming ; for the same reason why I chose basketball .
For example , if the shop is full of people , it is not enjoyable , because they will create too much confusion , too much noise with the risk of wasting time .
The last problem I would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there .
First it helps to make my social life convenient .
To sum it up , as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convenient .
I would like to know with whom I 'll share such wonderful days with the sports activities .
My Russian friend invited me to set up an exiting new business .
First of all , in order to our firm purpose I wrote an invitation to my favourite idol - the poet and singer Boris Grebenchekoff .
His one - week concert programme was so successful that we decided to invite him else , as soon as the tickets were all sold .
I had a nice experience as manager too .
I am writing about the letter that I recently received from you , which is about a competition in which I have won the first prize .
About the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent , because it is safer and more comfortable .
The two activities that I prefer are Basketball , because I played in my school 's team for almost a year , and Photography , which is a hobby that I am good at and I have done since I was ten .
People are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easy and familiar . It is one place where you can have lunch or dinner , watch a movie after that , and , if you want , buy something at the shops .
Instead of going to the theatre , which is more cultural , or even having a picnic at Ikurapiura park , people prefer spending all their money at shopping centres .
Circle theatre 's Manager : I am writing to you because I felt disappointed after seeing the musical " Over the Rainbow " .
First the actors who were supposed to star in this show were not the ones put on stage .
I had a discount ticket , but they refused it and I had to pay the full price .
Apart from this , the show started forty - five minutes late .
I think these reasons are sufficient to ask for my money back .
She was also concerned about being pregnant , but she was afraid to tell John about it .
He could n't believe what Pat had told him , so he broke Pat 's nose .
I am now writing this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer to stay in tents because I think it will be closer to nature .
Tennis is my favourite sport .
Shopping is becoming a popular way of killing time nowadays .
Try to imagine the scene : twenty or thirty or even more people are in a queue outside the fitting room .
The accommodation that best suits me is the log cabin , as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to having all my belongings in order and packed at all times .
With regard to the activities you offer , it is difficult to choose from such a huge variety , but I prefer to do those I know better such as climbing .
There are many things that can go wrong in the process of acquiring a product or service .
Hunting on the high street , or the shopping malls for the desired bargain - because we ca n't afford to buy anything otherwise - often becomes a desperate attempt to attain a lifestyle promoted by the new consumerist society .
In the end everything depends on our attitude to life , including shopping .
But even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear , or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms .
First I did n't accept but finally she convinced me .
I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californian summer is hot and dry so , because a tent 's wind circulation is better , it would create a comfortable coolness .
It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocritical cashier .
They had a concert in my home town , that 's why the organisers were looking for young people who could speak English .
The staff in that department were really friendly and helpful and they were also huge , like giants .
Basically , I helped them liaise with the local police and get some electronic equipment that they needed .
By the way , I have already been invited to their next concert .
You said that some discounts were available .
When I went to the restaurant I was really surprised .
In the advertisement you wrote " your perfect evening out " , that 's very funny .
It helps me when I study . I can find many things on the Internet or write my compositions on it .
I can find cold water in the refrigerator but 50 years ago they did n't have the refrigerator , so our life is easier today .
I think it depends if you are a man or a woman and now I have to say I am a woman and I enjoy it .
First of all , as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can get to know artists who come from different countries .
I always prefer to read books that are unusual in some way , because they give me the opportunity to escape from everyday reality .
They are the main characters of that book , and what characterizes them is the violence of their passions .
To make it worse , neither discounts nor restaurants were available that night although they were said to be available .
According to the owner of the restaurant , it was closed because the plugs of some lights were cut off .
However , I think there will be some differences in the quality and materials of clothes .
Although the appearance such as shape and colour will not change so much in fashion .
Some people are in a hurry , others are aggressive and most of the others are very stressed .
It is not always like that but we often see such a scene , even though shopping is becoming an entertainment not only for teenagers but also for adults .
Then , the show was meant to start at half past seven and I had to wait forty - five minutes because it started late .
I am writing this letter to complain about the treatment that we received when we went to the Circle theatre in order to see the musical show " Over the rainbow " , whose actors were Anthony Keens and Tina Truelove .
Indeed , it had a big swimming pool and a beautiful garden .
At first I was irritated that contrary to your announcements no discounts were available .
To my greatest disappointment Danny Brooks was not in the show , but his part was played by an actor whose ( lack of ) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement .
yours sincerely
Technology is essential to our life , we need it each minute , each second .
Good because you can have access to a lot of information , and it is bad because the computers are doing people 's work .
We really appreciate your organising a very nice programme , which has been organised by you this time .
In particular the River trip to Greenwich makes us very excited and we are really looking to forward to this .
We 're looking forward to your reply .
Invent glass was very eventually to architect .
Architecture with use of glass brought us modernism in 1980 .
In the future we can expect to have a new material and it will make our life more comfortable and convenient .
It is said that one of the reasons is that a small separate room makes children unsociable and depressed .
Also as producing new electronic , our home of the future will be more convenient .
In addition I would like to choose singing and photography because I am good at singing and taking photographs .
Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert a lot . Really it was a very interesting experience , particularly when I had to deal with a young group of children from Latin America .
It was incredible , because I learnt some Spanish words such as Hello , How are you ? goodbye
, What is your name , house , dog , cat , boy , girls etc . I am very happy that I promised myself that I would learn Spanish this Summer at Huntingdon College .
At the concert they were very successful because they were very confident and I helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic .
It seems to me that all these failures were your fault , because you were responsible for the organisation of the show .
However , considering that I saw the show , I would like to get a 50% refund .
Please reply at your earliest convenience .
That is why I think that modern technology helps me in my daily life .
I have once experienced having been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent due to heavy rain several years ago .
I would be really grateful if you could send me some information or any relevant brochure .
I 'm writing to you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play on at your theatre .
To begin with , the actor you published as going to perform , did n't .
People are getting more and more addicted to this , because it helps to make everyday life easier and more comfortable .
I 've recently been to one of your musical shows called " Over the rainbow " at the Circle theatre in London , thinking it might be a good idea but it was disappointing .
I 'm writing this letter to explain to you what happened and to look for a solution .
To begin , the organisation of your colleagues in the theatre was awful for various reasons .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so without want I knew that there was going to be a concert in our city given by , from my point of view , the best group in the world , Oasis .
At first I got more angry with Pat than with my other friends in the group , because Pat was and is my best friend .
Then I realised that she had reason . I was irritable because my parents were going to get divorced , but Pat would always be my best friend so I told her that I was n't angry with her and I was not going to go to the concert because I had to go to the court to solve my parent 's affair .
And that 's the story of how I missed the opportunity to go to the only concert that Oasis have given in my city .
Well , some people would say yes whereas others would disagree .
However , I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people 's privacy ; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed !
I was bored , so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going .
I would prefer to be accommodated in a log cabin as I do not like sleeping on a mattress and I get an allergy to rubber .
Could you , please send me some extra information regarding the amount of money I should take to cover any other expenses , and also , what kind of clothes I should take .
For the two activites that I chose are at first swimming . I am in the swimming team and I must go two times per week to train because I have a competition every weekend .
Could you tell me approximately how much ?
The concert sarted at 6:00 pm until 2:00 am , and I started to work at 12:00 pm to prepare the stage with the musicians .
After that , at 2:00 pm , when people arrived , I was at the entrance to take the tickets and , you know , it was incredible because some people slept all night in front of the stadium to be in the front row .
I saw old people , children .... and for me it was very strange and it was very interesting , because I met a lot of people and the best thing was that I knew the pop group who sang . It was fantastic .
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show which the Circle Theatre is staging . I recently had a week 's holiday in London and during my stay I went to your theatre to see " Over the Rainbow " .
In the advertisement , I had read that Danny Brook was starring but he was not .
The play should have started at 19.30 but it started forty - five minutes later , we were waiting there without anything to do .
After the show had finished , I went to the theatre restaurant to have something to drink and relax but it was closed because the staff was on holiday .
Moreover the discounts were not available as you said in the advertisement and I paid £ 20 .
I would like a refund because it was one of the worst evenings of my life . If this matter is not resolved , I will take it further .
Everybody agreed with her .
I 've received your letter and I 'm very happy to know that I won the competition and the first prize .
In answer to your question , I will have to say that I can only go to the camp in July because of my job ; they only gave me that month off .
I would prefer to do some climbing because that 's what I do in my spare time and I do it quite well .
Apart from that , if you give surfing classes I would love to take them ; surfing is one of my chilhood dreams that never came true .
I do n't know what type of clothes I have to take or the amount of money that I 'm going to spend , so if you , please , could help me by giving me this information I would be very pleased .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
We have all been shopping once in our lives and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable , why ? We had a class discussion and we all agree on some points .
For example , if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we are looking for , and instead of buying what we came for we will leave with lots of things that we liked but we will never use .
Most of the time he gets lost , or they start playing around , making noise , bothering people , etc ... And when this happens you get in a bad mood and you 'll have a bad day shopping .
So if you want to have a good , relaxing day shopping , we recommend you do n't go with your little brothers and to go with enough time to look around for what you really want .
I 'm writing to you because I went to the International Arts Festival and it was a pleasure .
On the other hand , I must tell you that some concert halls are too small , so you ca n't be comfortable enough to appreciate the event .
Considering the advertisement , which appeared in one of London 's newspapers , I would like to present you with some of my complaints about your musical spectacle .
Secondly , the time when your musical should start was changed , delaying your show for nearly one hour !
Neither the beautiful surroundings near your theatre nor the comfortable seats compensated for my horrible evening .
However , technology has a bad influence on us - generally on our health .
However , he did not act , and his substitute was not very good at acting .
I went to buy the tickets but when I paid there was not any discount available .
That Wednesday Pat phoned me and told me that Sally also loved Paul .
The weekend came and that Friday we went to the discotheque .
When Sally came out of the discotheque I was very angry and I started to shout at her .
Unfortunately I was very disappointed with it ; I was expecting the opposite .
First of all , the advertisement where you advertised your show and what the theatre provides is totally wrong .
I came to see my favourite actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but the actors whom I saw were other people .
Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy tickets and when I appeared in front of the ticket desk I found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the real price were n't the same , the real price was much higher .
Also the show started very late compared to what was written in the advertisement .
before the beginning ?
So , after all of that , I wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant . I was very angry when I appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice that the restaurant was n't open .
In fact I am writing to you with just one main aim . I 'll be really delighted to receive the money back for my ticket .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Faithfully yours
Look at the history books for 400 - 600 years ago , or even for the time of the First and Second World Wars , to see how society has changed , just because we stepped up the advance of science and technology .
On the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses , but on the other hand they discovered many illnesses which we had n't heard about before .
More and more people die from some illnesses whereas a long time ago fewer people died from the same illnesses , despite the fact that they had fewer medicines .
However , technology nowadays has improved so much and it has changed our lives a lot .
Today we ca n't even think how we could possibly live without computers or without aeroplanes .
The computer is our way of communicating with the outside world , whereas with aeroplanes we can reach our parents and friends easily and much faster than we would if we used boats or trains .
Every day scientists and technologists discover and produce more and more new things and that is good . It has to be like that , we have to go forward not backward from the point where we are now .
Society has to go forward not to stop in one place .
Actually , I read the advertisement for the show and there were a few mistakes in it .
After the play , we wanted to eat at the theatre restaurant but we could n't .
As you can see , there are some ( deliberate ? ) mistakes in the advertisement you made .
I quickly became bored by this hypocritical attention they gave me .
I am writing to complain about a musical show last weekend when I was in London .
I felt very upset about your advertisement was totally different from the musical show .
It was quite ridiculous !
She enjoyed sharing everything with Pat , whatever it was .
This made Nick very embarrassed and he felt hurt .
Finally , they got separated .
For example , if Diana , who was the ex - wife of Prince Charles , had n't been followed by paparazzi when she was dating a man , there would n't have been a car accident which caused her death .
It was a pity that the halls used for the classical concerts were too small .
When the sons were old they began to talk about their life , beginning with this story , which happened a long time ago .
17th June 2000
I 'm in London for the first time and I wondered what is interesting on your stage : I read in the newspaper the advertisement about the best musical show .
In the advertisement the cast was very interesting - Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
I decided to go to your theatre but at the beginning it was the tranbles .
In the advertisement it said - " discounts available " .
I 'm a teacher and in Poland I have discounts but in England I do n't . I know this is another country .
I was very suprised when I saw a different actor . It was n't Danny Brook .
I saw one week ago on TV ( the 23rd annual ) the fashion show in Paris and I was very suprised because of the style .
All the models had very strange long shoes made from black leather , the trousers were quite short and the jackets were elegant with emblazoned material .
People will wear clothes made from natural materials like silk , which will be comfortable and elegant .
Because the world is now a global village people will wear at least one item of traditional or national clothing ( for example a peasant jacket or hat ) , like they do now in rural areas from time to time .
Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you can not control the atmospheric conditions .
When you ask to , the sales person often answers that your size is out of stock .
It seems like a good opportunity to practise it .
I would rather stay in a tent , because I have stayed in tents before and I liked it . It is more pleasant than staying in log cabins and it is such a wonderful experience .
I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because a lot of things can happen to you .
Therefore she had to do a lot of tramits to cancel her credit cards and to change her plane ticket .
Well , regarding the accommodation at Camp California I would prefer staying in a tent .
Well this is absolutely true , especially when you go shopping on Saturday .
For example , you go into a clothes shop , you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt , so they are looking everywhere , pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want .
You get headaches , you get stressed , and finally you get bruises because of the woman who pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you ! ! !
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent , because I find it more comfortable to sleep in a bed , but it would n't be a problem if I have to sleep in a tent .
I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never tried before . That means I do not have any experience .
The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthwhile for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people .
I have just received your letter saying that I have won the competition . I must say I was really surprised and happy to be given the opportunity to join the Camp for two weeks .
I am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities , while I am there . Because of my studies , I will take painting , as this is the subject which I am finishing at college , always with important qualifications , and photography which has been my hobby since I discovered that I can mix , in practice , paint and photography .
Concerning accommodation ,
I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or on an excursion it is n't the same if I sleep in a cabin .
I really liked one of them concerning a holiday in Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included , for only £ 250 .
I went inside to ask about that package but they told me that it was gone , so , I went to many shops just to get the same answer .
As and advise try to go shopping in the out pick hours , and do n't waste your time asking for promotions advertised in the windows of the shop .
I 'm not really a young man and during the recent years of my life I becamehave become accustomed to comfort .
That was cruel , because I was very hungry after the show .
In spite of this , I have got all the equipment I need for painting and I paint very well .
The food was delicious and fortunately I did not have to pay for it .
I am very pleased to be the winner in your competition .
When I was at the university I was very keen on basketball and I played for the university team .
In 1998 we were the champion of the First National League .
Nowadays our shopping habits seem to have changed . I can clearly remember my childhood and our only local shop .
I was really astonished by all these shopping centres , like ASDA , HOMEBASE , etc .
One day I decided to go to the shopping centre which is only 40 metres from our house .
I 'd walked around for about 15 minutes until I found the door .
When I entered the shop I was a bit angry .
In fact , this activity seems to be very interesting .
Unfortunately , I have never tried but I feel like trying it .
The best thing to do would be to show the cooking personnel because they are very nice .
I advise finishing with a chemistry lesson so that people see the laboratory .
The advertisement promised us a perfect evening but it was n't , so I would highly appreciate it if you could completely refund our tickets .
Since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London , he told Pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical that I saw when I went to the theatre during my holidays in London .
To my surprise Danny Brook never appeared .
He is my favourite actor and I paid to see him not to see a different actor .
Finally at the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it had n't been repaired .
I enclose my postal addresses and I will be looking forward to a complete refund
Most of them believe that they are kind of crazy or evil .
Carol , a 16-year - old girl , said , " I imagine clothes in the future will be very strange .
Maybe they will be in many colours and they will be very tight .
They will be synthetic clothes , I think , made of plastic or something similar . "
Most young people like Carol believe the same and use their minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future .
After all , they 'll be the ones that decide what the Fashion of the Future will be like .
My name is Joseph and I am writing this letter to complain about the mess that the administration of the Circle theatre presented to me .
We paid to see Danny Brook , my son 's favourite actor , but we were quite disappointed . My son was very happy because he would see his favourite actor for the first time .
Expecting British punctuality , we went to the theatre at 19:00 to watch the 19:30 show but it only started at 20:15 . It finished later than it was supposed to and then we missed the train .
I did n't see any discounts available ; I thought my son would have paid less than I. As we had already missed the first we went to the theatre restaurant , which is famous for its good food , however , it was closed .
Because of this , the least you can do for us is to give me my money back and work hard so that this theatre , which is famous for its beauty and punctuality does n't become famous for its disorganised shows .
People have seen in the last 10 years how different our clothes can become .
Clothes used to be made of cotton , but nowadays we can see shirts , pants , socks .... made of almost anything .
Computers are little things nowadays , but at the speed at which technology develops , in the next century clothes will tell our doctors about our health at any moment , any time , anywhere , people will be able to locate us around the world .
In the future we wo n't buy clothes according to size or even colour . Our clothes will adapt to our bodies , the weather , our fit , all our needs .
I saw the musical show in your advertisement during my holiday .
I think after 100 years , at least something will change as regards design , material , colour , etc .
Since I was a child , I have been interested in camping and sleeping in tents .
For example , how much pocket money will be enough and what kind of clothes I should wear .
We think that this is a great opportunity and we are all very interested in going because we can see there the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , a lot of different kinds of make - up and some famous hairstylists .
The show is absolutely free for students .
I have further ideas . In the future , maybe in 2113 , there will be houses like now but with more technical things .
But I think that people will also need a bed and a table with a chair .
houses will only be more modern and more practical but not very different from our homes in the present .
The whole show and the acting was of a standard comparable to school theatre .
When we decided to visit the theatre Restaurant after the show it was closed because some decorating was n't finished .
It was this last point that got me angry .
After everything that had happened we went to the hotel tipped and very affect .
From a small village to the town was a very long way because people used a horse and wagon .
Every family now has a TV , to travel long distances we use not just the car but also the train and aeroplane .
Before we had a fantasy about how people might travel to other planets , and what we see now is a spaceship cruising in space .
Before it was only in our imaginations .
New technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier .
Everything that we do now we do with a computer : it helps to look after the house , to perform very difficult operations , because the computer can think much faster than a human .
And I can continue my list in this way ... because science never stops in one place .
Looking forward to your reply .
It was such a wonderful experience !
When Jane asked me to help her with the publicity and specially with the interviews , I just could n't believe it .
You know that I love going to concerts , but being at the beginning of the show and a member of the staff was something I was always interested in .
In the area of publicity we were about 50 guys , all of us investigating , calling radio stations , organizing the reporters , specifying where the press would be for the interview that took place afterwards ... yet , it was incredibly satisfying when everything turned out just fine !
Before I go to the Camp , I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and whether there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies .
I was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town .
Me and my friends were very excited , not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop singers and bands whom we would be able to see !
However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practising on the stage .
He started to consume the stuff at the age of twenty .
He had problems at home because his mother wanted to settle down in Australia , but Peter was used to living in New York , where it is overcrowded and he was surrounded by people .
But I have booked a flight home at the beginning of August .
Nowadays the Internet brings us closer and closer .
3 . Library .
We not only borrow books from a library but also study at a library .
With reference to the accommodation I would rather stay in a tent because I think it is the best way to socialize .
In addition I need to know whether meals are included or not with the accommodation so that I can decide how much I must have with me .
Just then Ake exclaimed that I could play the piano .
yours sincerely
The restaurant , which I decided to visit after the show to eat something , was closed without any explanation and the perfect evening was completely imperfect .
Often you wear very little but short skirts and tops .
The summers and winters get warmer .
Besides all those improvements and comforts I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
All these items of equipment are applications of modern science .
Thank you for this prize , I 'm really excited and emotional .
To answer your question , I would like to travel only in July because
I really appreciate this kind of trip and I 'm really grateful for your attention .
Yours sincerely ,
Women ca n't resist the temptation of shopping and they are disappointed when they do n't have the desire to shop .
Shopmania is really unstoppable . I know women who do everything they can to buy only a dress , or even worse , women who buy things they have no use for , for example , snap , sculptures , kitchen tissues , or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless , but they can not resist the fact of it " being there . "
There are many facts to prove that shopping is not " pretty and harmonious " , so believe me , it is not always enjoyable .
I am writing to you because I was very disappointed with the show you have put on to attract people to come to your theatre .
First of all , I came to see the play just because my favourite actress should have been in it , but she was n't .
The time of the evening performance on the ticket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15 , which forced visitors to stay in one place for 45 minutes , a waste of time .
The ticket discounts were not available under any circumstances and the theatre restaurant was closed .
I strongly recommend you to pay a minimum 50% of the full price that I paid .
Your faithful
I think that in 100 years from now , the clothes fashion will be totally different .
In my opinion the world itself will be different in temperature as a result of global warming , also people will become nicer , less this will take place , so the clothes will mainly be made from cotton with smooth colours like dark green or grey .
They will be comfortable clothes because the main point for any kind of clothing is to be comfortable .
Also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and Green peace will be very strong , much stronger and more powerful than it is now .
So we can imagine the Future Fashion might be pleasant or unpleasant for different people .
The styles will be more or less the same as each other and everyone will be satisfied with them .
I am writing to reply to your letter and communicate my acceptance of the first prize in your Competition .
This summer , I am available in July because in August my family and I are going to go to Canada and in September I will go back to university .
If there is no chance to go to California in July , I could wait until next summer .
About accommodation , I would like to have a log cabin because last year I had an accident and my back was injured , so sleeping in a tent would be painful for me .
Due to my back injury , this year I could not train and play with my team , so I am not fit . It would be a good idea to be a referee .
Although swimming is so boring , it would be a good thing to help cure my back .
Could you please let me know where I will eat ? If there will be a vegetarian menu ? And how much is it ?
And please could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes I will have to bring ?
It was a hard month because my job was very hard . I worked 12 hours per day but always with fun people .
I 'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show I saw during my stay in London .
If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and wherever he is I will be able to get through to him .
I 'm extremely happy because not only do I earn a lot of money but also I 'm learning a lot .
I 'd like to travel in July because I 've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July .
And I 'd like to stay in a log cabin because I ca n't bear sleeping in a tent . I hate that kind of accommodation .
I have recently received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in the competition .
It was very fortunate for me .
Please could you send me an itinerary of the trip ?
I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people , especially at the weekends , which normally is the only appropriate time !
Danny Brook was meant to be the starring actor but he was not , another actor took his place .
In the advertisement you say that there is a discount available but there was not .
I think the next time you write an advertisement you should put in the right information .
I did not have a perfect evening with so many problems .
Yours faithfully
Does technology have a bad or a good effect ?
In the 18th century , technology started to grow more and more and the 20th century was called the century of technology .
Technology helps people .
It informs people , hospitals use modern technology , and the computer helps staders and helps people do their job .
A lot of countries buy guns , for their defence they say , but they buy them to kill people .
Technology ca n't ever stop going forward , and so people always go forward but with the same effection of modern technology .
In the advertisement you promised a perfect evening out , but it was n't .
It was very disappointing for me that the actor was n't Danny Brook , as was promised in the advertisement .
So I want to ask for my money back , also I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisement .
But are they useful in every situation and everywhere ?
My opinion is that modern technology can help you to save time .
But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the restaurant after the show .
If I search for something like a telephone number or an address I also look it up on the Internet .
Another important point for me is that things like listening to music or watching TV sound better and the pictures on TV are being improved , because the machines become better .
The third problem was that it was written that discounts were available , but when I got there it was not true .
For example , a car , which is used by everyone every day , changed my daily life in the sense that I do n't need my dad or my mum to go ice - skating or to go to work . I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of technology , but because I can show that I am responsible .
In spite of the fact that the weather is bad , I play tennis .
In addition speaking activity includes everything for learning English such as listening , speaking , and grammar as well .
In other lessons , the teacher teaches lots of things which are grammar , English culture ... etc .
I play the classical guitar and I also sing . I have been playing the classical guitar for three years .
I wonder if you could tell me about the weather and what kind of clothes I ought to bring with me .
It was very shameful for my mum .
You also mentioned the activities I 'll be able to do .
Although I 've been playing tennis for five years , I ca n't say I 'm a very good player .
Firstly , the story takes place in South Africa , during the period of apartheid .
I think that you ca n't understand all the links between the events without reading the book more than once .
Moreover , once I was paying for the tickets , I found another thing out : there were no discounts available .
I had to go back to the hotel , because all the restaurants in the area were completely crowded .
Summing up , you might have realised that that was n't " my perfect evening out " which you promised , so I would like you to give me the money I paid for the ticket back .
She works as a model , and she was advising him about what clothes , etc , ... to buy for her .
I decided to go to a play at the theatre of which you 're the manager to see " London 's newest and best musical show . "
The principal reason I 'm writing to you at the moment is that I want my money back , because I felt so disappointed with the theatre and also with the play .
Before modern technologies arrived , you could n't communicate as easily as we can do today .
You can communicate with people in places where you would never imagine going to because it would be too expensive .
But , if you do n't like using the keyboard to say something or to communicate , you can use video conferencing , a system which lets you talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers .
The modern technologies mean I am able to listen the music I 've downloaded with the same quality as a CD , and if I buy a reproductor , I can carry this music everywhere .
Also computers and mobile phones have evolved thanks to modern technologies .
As far as accommodation is concerned , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable , and , therefore , I have never stayed in a tent .
To sum up , it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study , but it should concern their sports activities as well .
On that date , I decided to spend one evening seeing a musical show as I was on holiday in London and was interested in the musical show .
I found the theatre rather noisy as I arrived very early to sit in the front row .
However , something wrong occurred again . The actor ' Danny brook ' , whom you advertised in the brochure , did not play a part in the show .
I am not satisfied with your show as it was completely different from the advertisement .
It 's completely different !
Have you ever been to a fashion show named " New trend , New Millennium " ? '
How can we go out wearing those clothes ? '
On the other hand , some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so they prefer to wear nothing .
In fact , unlike the perfect evening out that you promised in your advertisement , I had a very disappointing evening .
There were also the discounts which were n't available .
Can you imagine how exciting it is when we are in the dark and very quiet and we can hear the sound of the animals .
I have been doing a lot of them when I have had some free time and when I feel impressed with where I have been .
Finally I would like to ask you about I have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because I will pack the clothes as useful .
It was brilliant .
You know , you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in they could n't wait to get to the front and they try to go through very quickly .
So you have to explain a lot of times to make people calm down and stand in a row .
Apart from that , here is the information that you asked me for :
- About the accommodation , as I read , you can offer me a log cabin or a tent .
That 's so good when you have the money to enjoy it but , apart from that , there are many problems .
Also there is a big problem : the money .
Secondly , I would be very grateful if you could accommodate me in tents rather than log cabins .
From the list of activities in which I will have a chance to compete I have chosen basketball and swimming .
But , is n't it a kind of entertainment ?
For example , imagine that you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate outfit .
I am writing this letter to complain about the Circle Theatre .
Secondly discounts were not available .
What 's more , the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished , because the show started at 20:15 .
It was not a perfect evening whatsoever .
Everything will be useful and convenient , even fashion .
The most important thing will be your figure , such as long legs or pear - shaped .
Traditional or Contemporary
In conclusion , the clothes will be more interesting than now for everybody .
I 'm used to sleeping in a tent from my previous holidays and I always enjoyed it .
I actually enjoyed it working there and I would n't hesitate to work there again .
The activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting . I chose to play basketball ( I play in a club , I am quite good ) and to do photography ( there must be beautiful pictures to take in California ) .
You asked me which accommodation I would prefer .
Moreover , the admission fee is free for students .
In addition to this you will be able to control all parts of the house by computer such as temperature or vacuum cleaning .
About the accommodation , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I have a bad back and I think that sleeping in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me .
Let us then ask : ' Is this activity always enjoyable ? '
Far from the strength that doing a sport or even going to work requires , going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier ; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money .
However , this apparently quiet and relaxed activity can sometimes turn into a living hell ; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then , if you do go , you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people , unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy with the mixture of smells that come from the people .
On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping is not a difficult activity , it is also true that it is definitely not an enjoyable one .
I received your letter this morning and I was very surprised by it .
I am writing to you about your questions .
First , I can come there only in July because of my examination , I have to take it in June , and my new term will also start in September .
My main work was to take people to their seats because of a concert hall , which was the millennium dome .
I also sold a pamphlet of that concert , CD and T - shirts .
I told you before Elton John performed at that concert , so there were a lot of famous people .
She was absolutely beautiful .
I 'm pleased to receive your letter and really happy that I won the first prize .
July is also good because the weather is warm and I could enjoy the time I will spend in the camp more .
I think I can handle it very well .
I 've chosen Photography because I love to take pictures !
if I have to take any special equipment for the activities that I 've chosen
Whether there is a phone , a fax or e - mail so I can be in touch with my family .
Yesterday was Valentine 's day here in Portugal . In particular I had to spend it alone ... again .
I 'm writing to you to tell you about a pop concert that happened here in São Rafael .
Red Hot Chilli Peppers came here for a short time and they played at the " Chedicard Hall " .
It was really cool because I did some backstage work .
I was everywhere .
I took lots of pictures , asked for autographs and I even gave them my cell phone number !
They promised me that they would call me someday , which I particularly doubt .
I hope you answer this letter as quickly as possible with lots of thing to tell me .
Dear Manager : I am Angela Ounis and I am writing to you because I went to see ' Over the Rainbow ' , London 's newest and best musical show .
Also it was said that Discounts would be available , but I did n't receive any discount as you were cheating us . I know that you have a big responsibility but if you have told something to people , stick to it .
I have learned a lot with the Internet . It gives me the opportunity to know more about things I never knew about .
I had n't thought about a restaurant to go to after the show , because if the advertisement had been right , there should have been a luxury restaurant where I could eat .
Yours sincerely
We are in the age of technological development , of that there can be no doubt .
First of all , we would like to say thank you very much for organising our tour around London and our programme , which is considered especially good for us because of the places we will visit .
Secondly , we saw last Saturday in the Oxfor News an advertisement about the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to know if it would be possible to include this show in our tour .
The show is going to take place in the General Exhibition Hall in London , Thursday the 14 of March , so it could be a good idea to see this show instead of going to the Science Museum .
We think that it could be a great opportunity because in one day we can see everything concerning fashionable clothes , new make - up and hairstyles .
In this letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for this trip .
I received your letter , which says I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I appreciate that and I thank you sincerely for having chosen me as a winner .
I accept and I want to inform you that I can travel only in July because I have booked my annual leave for that period .
I helped them to prepare the room for the bands and I decorated the place for the singers .
It took a long time to test the speakers and the microphones .
The audience was excited and I can not describe my happiness .
I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompanying our songs .
I am writing to you to give you some required information .
As you can see , I have absolutely no experience in it .
During my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show and unfortunately I had a very disappointing evening .
Lastly , about the ticket . The advertisment said ' Discounts Available ' but no way , I had to pay the full £ 20.00 and the restaurant was closed because of rebuilding or something .
However , the point that I am trying to make is that you just ruined my holiday .
Your advertisement was unfair .
As you are a manager , you have responsibility for justifying this problem . and I have a right to get fair treatment as a customer .
But I say fashion is Artistic inspiration which is expressed by fabric and all sorts of material .
As I said before , fashion is somehow influenced by science and inspirations that we get from all sorts of environments .
These days we are very interested in space and the millennium and things and many designers have shown millennium looks recently .
I expect human beings will live on other planets and travel around under the sea .
I think people will wear those spacy- and cyber - looking clothes after a century .
Can you imagine you and your friends going on a picnic to the Moon with a silvery skirt with astronaut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots ?
It could be more fascinating .
Swimming is my favourite way of exercising and keeping fit .
THIRDLY , I WAS VERY EMBARRASSED TO DISCOVER THERE WERE NO DISCOUNTS AT THE ENTRANCE .
I always have a positive approach with all of the most recent inventions or any other kind of modern appliance .
Anyway , the thing that has changed my daily life most is the personal computer and , especially , the Internet .
Also , the times printed in your advertisement were 14.30 and 19:30 .
In your advertisement , it said that discounts were available for the tickets .
I was rather thirsty and hungry after the show and your advertisement made a cup of tea and some cakes in your restaurant sound rather inviting .
It was not my ' perfect evening out ' , as your advertisement said it would be , and I would like some money back .
It 's a natural reaction to be angry with somebody you do n't trust for gossiping about you and bothering your personal thoughts .
But they do n't consider the problems the rumours may cause the famous family or couple .
In conclusion , no matter what the journalist 's aims are , famous people deserve to have their problems , their affairs , their private lives just as normal people do .
I saw your advertisement for your show at the circle theatre , over the rainbow .
Also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available , but there were n't any discounts .
First she said to her father , then to her mother and finally to her brother , that I was from another planet called Orion , that was a billion kilometres from Earth and then I was so ashamed because I have been her boyfriend since I came to Earth .
I would like to thank you for choosing me .
I am good at Basketball and tennis .
At university I attended tennis lessons for two years .
Finally I would like to ask you .
As I told you two months ago , I saw the advertisement in the newspaper .
Just before the concert I had to check that everyone was present .
The concert was brilliant .
It was terrible ! We had a lot of problems from the beginning .
Everything was all right during the band 's performance , but at the end some spectators came up on the stage and did some damage to the band 's instruments .
As you can see , hardly anything went well , but the lights and the sound - for both of which I helped carry things - were appropriate for the concert .
Firstly , it was written in the advertisement that there would be stars and artists from around the world . I believe that it 's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
That was excellent because it attracted people 's attention .
regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin . I think that will be safer for all my things .
The stage was gigantic . The crowd could be all around .
I mean , it 's still unbelievable . Can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking their hands .
Your advertisement was excellent and it gave me a lot of enthusiasm .
Then , I think it 's interesting to answer the following question :
This little essay shows that I depend on technology and , moreover , because I 'm in an electronic engineering school , I 'm keen on technology .
I presume if the term becomes longer the festival will become better .
I can say the actions which are prohibited at school are no problem at home .
We think that it is a great opportunity because it is just once per year and it is free for students .
We stayed at my aunt 's house which was in the centre of the village .
I looked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine .
The policeman came to take the burglar and thanked me for catching him .
The concerts and the dance show were incredible , except for the classical concert that was in too small a hall .
Secondly , the plays and films were very well organized despite the low numbers .
The art exhibition showed us a new lifestyle and society that was totally different from ours .
The talks by writers were very technical but they could be understood by all the people who were at the festival .
In conclusion , I was impressed by all the good organisation , the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events .
The price was excellent because there was n't any time limit .
I hope that you organise this festival for all the coming years .
At school you are n't allowed to bring in connected mobile phones although there is more than one student that does .
Teachers will take it from you if it rings during school hours .
If you break one of these rules you could be expelled for a week , a month or for ever .
As well will have the responsibility of looking after my brother when they are n't at home .
In answer to your question , I would n't change anything because I think that these are the minimum rules that a teenager has to have to be responsible in the future .
I would be very grateful if you could give me some additional information .
When she finished the sound check , I went to meet her . I told her I was very happy to be there and to have helped at the concert , and I asked her for an autograph .
I am willing to show you the autograph and the photograph .
When I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement , but they were not available .
Despite this I was still excited about the show , but then I suddenly realised that Danny Brook was not performing , he had been replaced by an extremely disappointing actor .
I 'm writing to you about our trip which you have organised .
Sincerely ,
They need to be with their family in peace .
In fact on the stage appeared a completely different person .
But to make everything clear I 'll start from the beginning .
Our parents were very pleased and happy we were so ambitious .
As a result we were grounded for all the holidays and all because of our almost perfect Pat .
And what better way to solve this than to give the festival an international character .
If you like fishing , you can try to collaborate with the local market or some shops , in order to sell them the fish you catch yourself .
I prefer to stay in a cabin because I have never been on holiday in a tent before , so I think it is more comfortable to sleep in a bed instead of outside in a tent .
The activities I would like to do during these two weeks are basketball and swimming .
I think I can play basketball well , because a few years ago I was a member of the school team .
Swimming is not my favourite sport but I prefer swimming to golf or tennis .
Please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for : is that including food and drinks , so that I know how much money I have to bring with me , and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that I know what kind of clothes I have to take .
I was the assistant of the person responsible for the clothes and make - up of the pop group . Really I was very nervous about that because it was my first time with such famous people , but I am very happy that all the things went very well . Kim , what I really particularly liked was when I was asked to do the make - up on my own . Really I was very nervous but at the same time very happy , but everything went well and everybody was very happy with my work .
Really I think you have to try to do the same thing next summer , I really enjoyed it .
You ca n't go outside in peace , and there is always a crowd of people who stand in front of your house waiting for you .
We have seen it in an advertisement and I would like to go to the show .
It is a great opportunity for us because the fashion is fascinating and free .
For example , we would be able to put off our visit to the science museums on Tuesday morning till Wednesday afternoon .
The fashion show starts at 10 o'clock and finishes at 7 o'clock .
Journalists follow famous people , such as politicians and film stars , in order to take photos and get information about them .
I think that it is very dangerous because the famous people can not have a private life and consequently they may suffer from depression and sadness , which may lead them to suicide .
I think that the government have to protect them and their private life from the journalists , by punishing journalists .
I am writing to complain about the Musical ' Over the Rainbow ' , performed at the Circle theatre last week .
What was supposed to be a perfect evening out turned out to be a disappointing one instead .
If I want to know how a friend is , I just have to phone him ; I can see how the world is getting on just by switching on the television , and I can cook in a few minutes using the Microwave oven .
In conclusion , I think that technology has two faces which affect my life as well as everybody else 's life .
As far as accommodation is concerned , I would like to live in a tent at Camp California .
I prefer this type of accommodation because I am used to living in tents during my summer holidays .
Concerning the accommodation , I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin , because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience I had in Ireland because of the weather ...
But so far I have only taken pictures on holiday and of some family celebrations .
Otherwise I had to keep walking until the train started .
I was sitting under a full - bloomed cherry blossom tree .
Their hobbies were listening to the radio , reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything .
The performances were great , but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people who were there that day .
So , in the daytime , we can focus on our studies .
George was about to be lynched on account of his skin colour .
The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisoner .
No one was guarding him .
One of the reasons that I have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays . In the future , I hope to be an actress and that 's why I want to learn something from the professionals .
They want too much fromstudent and are unkind to them .
I 'm writing to you to answer the letter in which , as you probably know , you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that camp .
I 'm writing to you to tell you how much I enjoyed last Saturday .
It was such a beautiful night ! Unforgettable .
I had always dreamt of being near " The Cranberies " , but I had never thought that the dream could become reality .
During the afternoon , Tim and I spent the hours before the concert lying in the park next to the sports hall where the concert was to be held .
After a few minutes the dream happened : Kare - the guitarist - appeared over there .
Finally he said how grateful he was and allowed us to stay with them till the concert started .
As far as accommodation is concerned , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
I have been travelling every summer since I was eighteen years of age and this type of accommodation is part of the ritual .
Thanking you in advance , I am looking forward to your prompt response to my questions .
I went as a volunteer in order to go for free .
The accommodation and the food were part of the contract ... everything free .
I met lots of nice cool people , and what I most enjoyed was the crazy atmosphere of the whole thing .
The best thing was that I have learned how to take care of their expensive instruments and I have sung my favourite songs with them .
There are so many monuments in California and so I will remember this holiday with my photographs .
Finally I would like to ask you if I need any money , because you say all accommodation and travel costs are paid for .
He also gave me his address and telephone number if I need help from him in the future .
It continues to develop and always will be the most important thing in our life .
When I asked something about a " discount " , your staff said that it was impossible .
Becouse my favourite actor appears in it .
We waited for the show to start for about one hour and forty - five minutes .
During the show , we did n't see Danny Brook , who is my favourite actor .
If Danny Brook does not appear , you have to say something about this to the people who are there in the theatre . This is your unforgivable mistake .
After the show , we were still angry . We wanted to eat something in your theatre restaurant .
Yours faithfully
Everything is easy now .
There was n't any discount available for the tickets and I went to the theatre with my three cousins from Brazil .
faithfully ,
With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access the Internet to communicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from us .
Besides this , the information goes faster than it used to now and it 's available at the same time in every part of the world .
First of all , in your advertisement for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part in the show .
The people who were there to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long . And I absolutely agreed with them .
Also in the advertisement you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't , and also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to eat some thing or to have a drink .
So , the next day Pat went and told his sister Sally that her friends were organising a surprise party for her birthday .
When Sally heard that , she was very surprised and very excited .
But although she was acting like this she was very angry with her brother Pat , because he did n't keep the secret .
Suddenly they all shouted " Surprise ! " .
Sally , although she knew about it , seemed very surprised !
So her friends did n't realise that she knew about the party and they were very happy because they believed that the surprise party had been a success !
It was an unforgettable night ! ! !
I am writing to complain about the evening at the Circle Theatre presenting " Over the Rainbow " .
Everybody will wear anything he / she likes , choosing clothes from any century they wish without this being strange .
On the other hand , if human society changes to become stricter and more limited , there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing , formed by the needs of society .
I 'm very sorry to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening .
First , I got there at 7:00 pm , because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm , and I needed some time to buy the tickets . I bought two tickets for £ 20 and when I asked for a discount , they did n't give me one , then I was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm .
Later when the show finished , I planned to go to the restaurant and get some food , but it was closed , because it was being repaired .
I was in love with a friend 's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair , but when I made the big mistake of telling my little and terrible secret to Pat , everything started going wrong . Katrin , my friend , and the one I was being bad to , was very upset with me , and she was right , but I really did n't know what to do . I was in love with Brett , but I loved my friend too .
Then I decide to talk to Katrin . I was very sorry for all I had done , so I apologised to her and promised her that this would never happen again .
Recently I decided to see Over The Rainbow , a very famous and well - known show .
Furthermore , I was shocked when one of the main actors came onto the stage .
He was n't Danny Brook , one of the reasons for my choice of coming to see Over the Rainbow .
A century ago , when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plough behind them , we 've got the word " time " .
I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role to play , especially today when fuel is so expensive .
I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement for the Circle theatre said about the musical show called '
Moreover , as I had read the advertisement carefully , I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theatre 's restaurant .
So , because of the things I have mentioned , I think I should be given some money back .
I look forward to receiving some information from you .
In addition to this , there is less communication between members of my family , because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time , the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television .
On the other hand , and in conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living surrounded by lots of gadgets with different functions .
In the advertisement for the show you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise there was a different actor , and that really disappointed me .
Then the show was supposed to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15 , more than half an hour late .
I had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there were n't .
And the theatre restaurant was being painted , so I could not go there .
As you may understand it was not a perfect night and I was not pleased with the show or even with the service .
Technology , are we prepared for these advances ?
Technology improves our lives , we have high - tech equipment for cooking , for work , for study , well nearly for everything .
And when we understood the Internet , we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able " to chat " with them was the height of technology .
But now we can even see the face of the person we are chatting to . The Internet is amazing .
And now of course there will be someone trying to improve it .
Technology changes our daily life , it makes our life easy to live and of course more comfortable with computers , televisions , radios et cetera and sometimes safer , as with medicine .
Definitely we should try to understand technology . If we know how to use it , technology will improve our way of life .
When I met Caballos , my best friend , I felt embarrassed and disappointed and I could n't say anything .
It is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping .
When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place , all trying to find the best prices and not caring about anybody , this could drive anyone crazy .
The long queues , crowded places , high prices , sales , all these things combined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it .
So while I am at the Camp I want to take a lot of photographs and climb a mountain .
Shopping sounds very enjoyable and is fantastic for women . You can find a lot of interesting things which were unexpected .
They are also the lessons which English people and other foreigners are particularly curious about .
This is a good opportunity to see how they learn in class .
In conclusion , besides all that I mentioned , I highly recommend you video the students ' daily life and interview them .
In fact , now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries , for example , in the morning and receive their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing .
Therefore I regard the Internet as quite a powerful tool and I believe it has given more strength to relationships between people .
I am really glad to receive the first prize in your competition . It will be very pleasant joining the holiday .
Regarding your first question , I would like to travel only in July because it is my school holiday so I would not miss any classes .
As regards activities I would choose singing and surfing . Surfing because it is my favourite sport . I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good at it . And singing because I really love it . I am not as good at singing as I am at surfing but I like doing it .
I only had to stay behind the drummer supplying them with water whenever they wanted .
I had a really nice time with them even though I would've preferred to stay at the front with the other people ,
I hope you 've enjoyed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
I received your letter and would be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July because in June I will be in Austria with a friend and for August I have rented an apartment with my family .
You can come across a very disagreeable shop assistant and if you find what you wanted , you will not want to pay him or her for it .
There is nothing more disagreeable than that .
Further to the unpleasant event that took place last week , it is my right to complain about the musical show I saw when I was in London .
The show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it did not start until 8:15 . Then I felt disappointed because the main actor had been changed .
If that does not seem enough , after the show my boyfriend wanted to take me to eat something in the theatre 's restaurant but the unpleasant surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday .
I 'm always having holidays in July . It is my favourite time for holidays .
Just the necessary .
I think the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit ( ? ) , in the intellectual life .
We must do something to help other people to feel better and be useful .
It was very interesting , because I did different things .
I took some photographs and I 'll show them to you when you come next week
Dear director of the Circle Theatre !
On Friday we , my friend and I , visited your theatre to see ' Over the rainbow ' .
It should have been my best evening that week , unfortunately it was n't .
Instead of 7.30 am as your advertisement said , it started at 8.15 am .
When the show started Danny Brook was not acting , which was a great disappointment for us both .
We are both big fans of his
When the show was finished we went to the restaurant to have something to eat .
But then it was closed for repairs .
Because of all this trouble I think we should have our money back .
And next time , make sure that your advertisement is accurate !
When were nine years old and were in third grade we had a ' House ' where we used to play all afternoon .
In fact it was n't a real house , it was some stones between the trees in the little forest near our house .
It was a secret place and we had promised each other not to tell anybody about it .
Usually we were cooking flower soup , and swapping secrets .
One day when I was there alone , I heard some other kids approaching . I sat down behind one of the stones so they could n't see me .
One minute later , Pat and half our class stood in ' the House ' looking and laughing at me and my flower soup .
Maybe she did it to make friends .
I do n't want to be rude , but this is not professional at all .
Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at your restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock ,
So I am asking you : why do you advertise it if is not going to be available to the audience ?
First , I am very disappointed about the star .
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO DESCRIBE MY DISAGREEABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE LAST SATURDAY , AT YOUR SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
BUT WHAT I CANNOT FORGIVE YOUR COMPANY IS CHANGING THE TIME IT STARTS AT THE LAST MINUTE , MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK 'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISAPPOINTED .
WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED , WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER , AS YOU SUGGESTED IN THE PROGRAMME , BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS ON PUBLIC WORKS ! ! !
Definitely the worse .
I would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us of your decision as soon as possible .
There are people from both sides of the argument who have strong feelings .
Both of them are my favourite sports and I 'm quite good .
You asked me for some further information and here are my " desires " :
I stood at the entrance and there I had to check the tickets .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Famous people have always been the centre of interest for a number of people .
This show would give us a lot of information about current activities , fashion and what is happening here in London with , for example , the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up , and hairstyles .
If you agree , after the Science Museum , we can have lunch at a restaurant near the museum , then we can go directly from the restaurant to the Central Exhibition Hall .
It does n't matter who they are , where they come from , what colour skin they have .
There will be a number of Developments in Technology in the future , which could make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is the feeling of being together and love .
Therefore , I hope that you can agree to a suitable arrangement between you and me .
I started training in 1996 , and I have never given it up .
There are more and more retailers opening .
I could n't believe my luck . I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Mediterranean Sea .
Thirdly , the person on stage was very strange to me , because I expected to see " Danny Brook " , but I did n't .
Although modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living , can it give you nature , peace and fresh air ?
Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment , or I should say angry , better sad . I would never have expected that I could be so deceived .
This is not the first time I have been to your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays , but be sure " Over the rainbow " will be the last one .
As I am specially fond of musicals , I even travel abroad to see what 's new , I am probably one of your most devoted customers . I know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business .
Of course , you should give a refund for the money spent , not only to me but to all the audience .
New fabrics create new textures , all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions , to refresh old ideas , to make new proposals that will last , as always , just a few weeks .
Have you noticed that all the classic gentlemen wear the same type of suit ?
And what about those kinds of intellectual and progressive people , do n't they all wear the same type of ugly but comfortable shoes ?
I am sure that fashion will survive for ages , it will even change to become easier to use and cleaner , because we all need to feel a part of our society , communicate our way of living and thinking , be part of a group and , at the same time , be different .
- When the musical finished I was terribly hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisement said that it would be open .
Modern technology has changed my life in many different ways :
To summarize , the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things which would be impossible in the past but also creates many problems .
As I was so looking forward to seeing Danny 's performance , I was very disappointed .
It is a very good schedule , especially because you have considered different activities for us .
Personally , I think it could be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attend , and we are all interested in the latest fashion .
We discussed the programme , and because the show will take the whole day , we would not mind going to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having free time all afternoon .
I did n't even think of looking down .
The clock was running .. tick , tock ... And suddenly everything stopped .
I felt an enormous peace .
Fortunately , I was n't alone .
Thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this three - day programme in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there , especially in the National Art Gallery .
The thing is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Furthermore , students can enter free !
Thank you for your attention and understanding .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers which will control everything , every item of furniture , light , temperature .
But , on the other hand , people will still have to programme them , as they have to do nowadays .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , cups will be washed automatically .
IT 'S UNDENIABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING .
IN CONCLUSION , I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY .
During these past few decades , or rather in the 20th century , there has been a great deal of development in modern technology .
One of the essential developments has been in our means of transportation .
Another significant technological development is the invention of electrical appliances .
Modern technology helps people in many ways and is indispensable .
When the show finished I was intending to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed .
I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disappointing experience I have ever had .
When I wake up I take a shower using electricity then I prepare my breakfast in the oven then I go to school by bus , when I arrive at home I put my lunch in the microwave then I watch TV and do my homework using a pen . When I come back from jiu - jitsu I eat something that was cooked in the oven then I go to bed .
About a millennium ago everything was different ; people did n't have electricity , they cooked their food on the fire and they did n't have pens .
Regarding the two activities I have to choose , I decided to choose a new activity that I have never done before , which is Sailing . I am a total beginner at this .
The other activity is Photography . I am not an expert , but I know how to use a camera . All I want is to improve my knowledge .
I helped them with organizing the stage , cleaning everything , fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guitars !
I had put some money aside for that month , thinking about the discount , but when I went to buy them they said that discounts were not available .
Waiting for your reply .
When she finished school , she went to study at the Agent Training Agency where she learnt about guns , clues , agencies , etc .
She was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a Trade Centre there .
Here is some further information about myself and a few enquiries .
It is really fascinating to challenge the waves .
As for accommodation , I would prefer log cabins , because I believe they are more comfortable than tents .
Will I be given any pocket - money or do I need to bring my own money to cover additional expenses ?
Martial arts are really exciting and are a great thing to film .
The main character is the old man who has to fight against the sea to stay alive .
They 're fighting for the same reason with the same strength , the man has to kill a brother , as he calls the fish .
On account of the fact that staying in log cabins is much more interesting than staying in tents .
I can sing plenty of songs , which include English songs and the Japanese songs , and I have a part - time job singing at a restaurant .
Furthermore , I am going to enter a competition next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable . Sometimes there is a long queue or a machine is broken .
A lot of circumstances will arise .
Everybody had gone to buy lunch in the supermarket . In fact , nobody likes crowds and queues , especially not in the summertime .
Obviously , I had to try another aisle .
It was the longest queue I have ever been in .
Even though I think most of the time it is very interesting , sometimes it gets people upset .
Finally , the reasonable price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point , because all kinds of people can afford to buy them . I also think that you should have a snack bar or a little restaurant so that the people are not too hungry and moreover you can make a lot of profit .
In conclusion , I do n't want to change anything in my house or at school , because I totally agree with the few rules that I have .
I have chosen the two following activities .
I have chosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport . I love water but I have never tried this sport before .
Yours sincerely .
People are often irritable and aggressive .
Because women love shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always give your opinion about clothes , music , perfumes ...
yours sincerely
The things I did were : preparing and checking the equipment , I had to clean all the stadium , making sure that all the lights were in perfect working order , that the singers were comfortable and relaxed , etc .
It would be a great pleasure to spend two weeks at Camp California and I ca n't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm .
With regards accommodation I would prefer log cabins , as they are more comfortable and I like convenience .
They are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbour jealous .
So , as a conclusion , I might say that shopping is n't enjoyable at all and I 'd rather stay at home instead .
After the show I needed to drink something in the theatre restaurant as the advertisement conceived , but it was closed .
When Pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers there were no problems .
Insofar as I came here especially to see him play , I have been very disappointed , and this could be the understatement of the year , as he is my favourite actor .
Thirdly , the ad mentioned possible discounts .
Personally speaking , I did n't see them and did n't even hear of them : I asked about it , but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts .
As he closed his eyes , he started to travel along the dark paths of his conscience .
The boy could not believe what he was hearing .
At these words , Paul suddenly awoke .
The show was called " Over the rainbow " and should be , to quote the advertisement , London 's newest and best musical show .
I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisement , but I had to pay the full price although I am a student .
The perfect evening you promised in your advertisement was the complete opposite and that is why I want to get some money back from you .
First of all , I was attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who performed effectively that evening .
These actors appeared forty - five minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement .
And in conclusion I want you to give me my money back , ( I still have the advertisement if you want proof of what I say ) .
As regards accommodation , I would choose to stay in tents .
I do n't know much about the weather down there , in California , so I am rather puzzled about what to wear there .
Also , I would like to know how much money I will need and which expenses I will have to cover myself .
All these exhibits are really important and exciting for us because , nowadays , fashion has a huge influence on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it .
We think that we could go there on the 14th of March , in the evening , instead of going shopping .
Nowadays , there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements , reports about their last romance ... but not everyone does the same thing .
On the other hand , there are the ones that are also respectable but , apart from their relations with journalists because of their work , they really need to be constantly sought by photographers .
The media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work , politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous .
In conclusion , I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidentally get into a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully .
In your letter you ask me to choose which type of accommodation I prefer .
Hopefully I will meet some other girls interested in the same sport .
Woods is thought to stand for all white people and this book could have an influence on them .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because I am allergic to some insects that might get in a tent .
I spent two weeks preparing the stage , speakers , backdrop , microphones , everything , with all the staff , and every night the artists came to rehearse their show . I could see how they really improved , and how nice they were with the staff .
I am writing this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called " Over the rainbow " with my wife and children . We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one .
But cars create pollution : for example the greenhouse effect .
Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences like medicine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live longer .
In my opinion it 's a lot better than the dictionary because it 's faster and you really find what you need .
I am writing to you about an enjure that I had at your last musical at the Circle Theatre .
First of all , I was surprised that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not perform .
I read in your advertisement in Friday 's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the performance started at 20.15 .
I was waiting 45 minutes for nothing !
I am a student and I did n't get a discount ticket .
I do n't understand the problem between your advertisement and the reality .
For example , if I do n't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework , I go on the Internet and ask for what I need .
From my point of view , the Internet is the most important invention of the 2000 century . You can book tickets for the theatre , sport , etc .
I use the Internet all the time for my homework and in the future , I hope , I will be able to use it for my own work .
Technology will not stop growing and helping people in the future .
It was n't the first time I saw this show in your theatre , but it was the worst one .
At first it was a great pleasure for me to get a ticket because I 'm one of Danny Brook 's greatest fans .
It 's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had chosen it , because I 'm ( allowed ? ) .
When the musical started at 20:15 ( not at 19:30 as advertised ) I was really shocked when I realised that a different actor was playing his role .
You have to know that I am very sick because of my blood pressure and so I was laying down the whole weekend .
For me , as a scientist , it 's a big problem to show how the innovations of the last century went up with the environment and nature .
Nowadays a simple thing like a computer includes so many possible ways of destroying different environmental compartments .
On the one hand there are the materials from which the PCs are made , on the other hand is the huge waste problem .
Now I try to show , in my daily work , how the airborn chlororganics , which are degased from plastics , will be separated and damaged by green plants .
Sometimes it seems to me like a joke if I think about all the dangerous materials I need to do my job .
Therefore it makes sense to use the innovations which are causing environmental destruction .
When I was 15 , I was starting to look for new clothes , shoes , and everything I would find now unnecessary .
I would not dare to calculate how much I have spent on those things without thinking .
However , it was not bad . My mum always told me that I had n't earned enough money so I should n't have spent it in the wrong way .
I have never been to the USA , so I think that this trip will be an unforgettable experience .
I look forward to receiving your reply .
For practical information , this show starts at 10.00 and closes at 19.00 .
It is not too far and the opening hours suit us .
We also suggest visiting the Science Museum on Wednesday morning and in the afternoon , if some of us are interested , we could see the National Art Gallery .
They will become less dark and more comfortable than today .
These improvements will be involved by the lack of petrol and non - renewable energy .
About the size of houses , I think that in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation .
But about the differences between the homes of the rich and poor , they will be the same in the future .
I think that people will be as alone and jealous as today .
As if this were not enough , once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for maintenance .
After reading the whole organized programme , we all agreed about the sightseeing tour by bus around London , which will give us the knowledge of this fantastic city we have all wanted to have since a long time ago .
We found the advertisement in a local newspaper and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity , because the show consists of these topics :
Instead of going to the science museum , we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which is open on Tuesday , March 14 , from 10 am to 7 pm .
Yours sincerely
Not only because she 's famous and wrote lots of books , but she knows how to introduce characters and how to tell a good story us though deceiving the readers .
In other words the story is set on a train which takes a trip along the orient .
On the train , all the passengers seem to be involved in a crime .
This is such a fascinating story and it 's the way Agatha Christie tells it .
The mystery is drawn out until the last page of the book .
I like Danny Brook very much , and his unexpected absence caused me great sadness .
It 's all right , but I also think that he 's exaggerating .
I do n't think I have done such a bad thing as to destroy our friendship .
I like his company , and we are happy when we are together .
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " , PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO ; FIRST OF ALL , I READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW , BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS A DIFFERENT ONE , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING .
I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOP ALONG VERY DIFFERENT LINES : THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST , AS WE CAN NOTICE NOW , OR A MORE FANTASTIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT .
SURELY , ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV . AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE , I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON COMFORT MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE .
BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD , IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE , THAT IS A TOO VARIED A CATEGORY .
One of my hobbies is photography , so I think I am rather good at it , but I will take painting to learn , because I am not very talented at it .
After carrying stuff like lights , microphones , wires and some other equipment for about three hours , I was exhausted .
It 's a great opportunity for me to participate in your Camp California because normally I work a lot and I ca n't spend money on travel . Moreover , I have to support a big family because I 'm married and I have three children .
I have to choose painting and photography therefore . I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think of my health .
I 'm very enthusiastic and I wait for your answer as soon is possible .
FIRST OF ALL , IN YOUR ADVERTISEMENT YOU SAID THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE , BUT I COULDN'T FIND THEM AVAILABLE ANYWHERE .
THE PLAY STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT : FORTY - FIVE MINUTES LATE .
MY ADDRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE . I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE .
I like to sleep in a tent under the open sky since I have done military service , therefore I would prefer a tent as my accommodation .
It is important for my health that I swim an hour a week because I am overweight .
When I have enough money the price is n't important , then I can buy a lot of things without considering my money .
Finally , I am going to write about the theatre , the Circle Theatre .
I 'm looking forward to receiving a letter from you .
The rooms will be designed in a futuristic fashion , where there will be less furniture and everything will be compact . Even TV - sets will be on the ceiling .
Technology also means all electrical machines , which do n't stop being developed .
Machines have replaced the work of humans .
Our whole life is being simplified by machines for not waste the time to work on their development .
Here I will answer all the questions that you asked me , and I will ask you about other things that you did n't mention .
I 'd like to organize my trip for July because that is when I have vacations , also because it is summertime in the U.S.A . About accommodation at Camp I 'd prefer a tent , because it 's a new experience for me and I 'd like to sleep in a tent to have a great time while having a new adventure .
Thank you very much for your cooperation .
Most of the time when we go to the shopping centre we have a lot of fun . We go to stores to look at clothing , we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries , but is not enjoyable all the time .
In that instance we do n't enjoy shopping because we ca n't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping centre .
I was absolutely thrilled to receive the news about my winning a competition .
I do n't like cold nights and mosquitoes .
Yours faithfully
Usually people do n't have time for shopping .
There are huge queues to the tills , noise , hassle , poor customer service .
You 've got more stress , you feel fed up and finally when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you thought .
There are so many varieties of products , different prices , different qualities .
Nowadays technical progress gets close to us , to normal customers .
Without any hassle , sitting in your chair in front of your computer , in a second you can get to any shop that has an internet site - most of the big companies have one - get all the information about the product , get a cheaper price and buy it .
I know that staying in a log cabin is more convenient but I just want to have a wilder experience .
And I want to know how much money I have to bring for personal expenses .
Besides , I really would like to know approximately how much money I should take with me .
Concerning the activities , I have chosen two of them .
It was boring that nothing happened for such a long time on the stage .
And finally , I would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought I would go to ' Theatre restaurant ' .
This is not a taboo subject with me and my friends .
I had doubts when somebody said that the fashion of the future would be different .
Are they included in the prize ?
I 'd prefer it if you gave me this information as soon as you can .
However , those days were unforgettable for me .
I will be very happy to travel in July because in that month I am going to have my holidays , so I will not have to ask permission from my boss .
I would prefer to stay in a tent , because in that way I can feel closer to nature , and I can remember when I was a girl scout .
At the camp I would like to choose two activities , Painting and Singing . I love painting . At university I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint because I work in a bank and I have a baby .
The reason for my choice of singing is that I feel embarrassed about my voice , so maybe I could improve it .
Thank you for giving me this opportunity .
You are never going to believe what I did last month . I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus , when suddenly a man stopped us saying that he was looking for people to help at a concert and they were going to pay us five pounds an hour .
We said yes immediately . I nearly shouted with happiness when they told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert . He is my favourite singer .
The concert was on a Sunday and we had to work at the back of the stage , doing all sorts of things like collecting rubbish and helping other people who were working there .
Other bad points can be mentioned , like pollution for example .
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show , where everything was completely different from the advertisement .
Modern life has been full of science and technology .
I am very pleased that I was born in a time when there is such good technology but my parents did n't have the same luck .
My life is much easier with all this stuff mentioned above - technology and science .
The bad side is we can use technology for war - missiles , weapons , etc ....
Indeed technology has changed our lives , we have become more sceptical and cold .
Sometimes I think technology is not a good thing ....
People whom I work with are going on holiday in June and August .
Also , the accommodation I would prefer at Camp California is the log cabin , because first when I was a little child we stayed in a small house every holiday and I like that .
However , drawing some beautiful scenery and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me .
I 'm not keen on liars , Mr Smith , and I think that you 've lied to naive tourists like us : some brilliant actors were supposed to play the parts and we only had different , pitiful ones .
Otherwise I 'll have to put some other ads out in London saying that your show is just a fraud !
Nowadays , the Internet and the mobile phone , with the development of satellite communication , seem to take the lead .
As far as I am concerned , the first way modern technology influences me is through my work : the Internet has become such an incredible tool , I can research into everything I want , find information for lectures , for example , or exercises .
Maybe it will change me into a kind of self - centred person , a loner .
But we should not forget that they are only tools and should emphasise human relationships .
Finally , I 'd like to play tennis and to try climbing .
This book remains one of the best in American literature .
Based on a very simple story , the story of an old man fishing , it is a deep reflection on age .
A veteran fisherman takes his boat and goes fishing to convince himself and other men that he is still able to do it .
The 24-hour fight is described in such a peaceful , faithful way that it callas a though about life and death .
I recommend this book as a way to discover both Hemingway and American literature .
Before answering your letter ( which I have just received ) about the prize for the competition I recently won , I 'd like to say thank you very much for giving me the chance of going to the USA .
About the accommodation , I think I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent , since it is more comfortable .
In addition to this , I would like to know the amount of money I should bring , as well as the kind of clothes that I could need and the sort of people that I will find there .
None of the groups are known at the moment , but I believe they are well on their way to becoming famous bands .
This was the best part because when everyone was gone , Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginners ! ! !
I could n't believe my eyes ...
Jane took a photograph of us together .
Lastly , I do not think I would call this my perfect evening , so I would like to ask for a refund , and I hope as the Manager of London 's newest theatre , you will handle the situation favourably .
Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality , he 'll never be able to keep any secrets from anyone , even himself .
Although , we are great friends , sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes , and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight . It all started when once I accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house , and there were lady 's knickers inside . I was so nervous and embarrassed , so I told Pat and off he went : he told every single student in the school that I 'd stolen a girl 's knickers , and everyone started to call me a pervert .
When I was a young child , I used to be interested in reading science fiction .
First I can travel only in July because I will finish school at the end of June and I will sit my exam in September ; so I have to revise for it a lot during the month of August .
I particularly liked seeing all those people , and I met a lot of new friends there .
I would like to travel only in July because I would be on school holidays then and the weather is hot and the sea 's temperature is less cold than in winter .
It is very nice to stay in tents which are strong and comfortable .
And you need a strategy to win the match .
But you ca n't play if there is too much wind , because the ball becomes uncontrollable !
It looks fragile and it could break easily .
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautiful country .
It will be very interesting for me because normally I do not have a lot of time to do activities .
I would prefer swimming because I really like it and I am trying to swim whenever I have got some time , and painting because I have finished a painting course and I have some practice with this .
That is very nice that all costs are paid for but I would like to ask you how much money I should take with me because I do not know anything about prizes in the U.S.A. and please tell me if I need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me , so if I will need to take everything I will just change this activity .
It was a really wonderful new experience for me .
The people were wonderful , they were helping each other with everything and it was a lot easier to do .
I am writing to you , because I would like to disagree with your advertisement for the show ' over the Rainbow ' .
As it is said in the advertisement the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes , because according to the programme it started at 20.15 , but that is not the end of the story ; in your advertisement it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets . That was not true !
I was still not very disappointed , because I hoped that I would have a good meal with a glass of wine in the restaurant , which I could have according to your advertisement , but what I did not realise , it was closed , because the chef was in hospital .
Such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world , even if I am not at home ; I use a stereo if I want to listen to my favourite music ; I use tapes , CDs , hairdryers , etc .
Many years ago people did n't have an opportunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot .
This is just a note to confirm for you that I have received your letter .
To answer your questions , I would like to tell you that I can only travel in July , because I will be studying for the Cambridge exam till 1 July .
Would it be possible to have accommodation at Camp California in a tent , because I haven't had a chance to sleep in one .
And would it be possible to do swimming and surfing .
I have been dreaming about this activity since I was 10 years old .
I would like to know how many people will stay with me in the tent , and do I have to take with me any special clothes for surfing .
I look forward to being at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I think going shopping in a big space like Harrodss is not a pleasure .
I like to be in small boutiques , and I would rather go shopping along and during the weekend .
And going shopping after the weekend is not for me .
I would like to travel in July because I am a student so I only have holidays in this part of the year .
About the accommodation , I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to staying in them when I travel .
Sometimes , shopping can be really boring , especially on important dates when the shops are absolutely crowded and you ca n't see anything you wanted with careful .
I received your letter this morning . Thank you very much for your kind letter and for choosing me .
I have knowledge of navigation , engine , ropes and knots , and sails as well .
It was a nightmare , there were pickpockets in the shop .
But you must always be on your guard against pickpockets .
I am only able to take my holiday in July . The rest of the year I work .
I 'm crazy about tennis and swimming .
Can you imagine Friday night ?
You have worked hard all day . On the way home you want to pick up some milk from the shop and you have to wait ten minutes on average .
There are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult .
After shopping you have to carry a heavy bag a long way home
But the situation was n't simple , so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary , the teacher 's cousin .
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accommodation because I have had all my holidays with my parents in luxury hotels .
Pat entered the fight , and it became more loud and aggressive .
I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely disappointed by the show .
It was about 21:00 , I thought it was a bit later but it was n't my fault anyway .
100 years ago , people dressed differently .
The environment will be very polluted and finally we 'll get diseases . We will need helmets to cover our heads and we will also need air - supplyer .
Maybe , science will be developed and make our environment clean , and we will not wear anything at all ! ! ! ( except underwear ) .
I hope that the environment will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be .
The advertisement promised there would be my favourite star , Danny Brook , but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook . In addition , the performance started 45 minutes late , so we could n't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already .
So I am sure you will understand why I am so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incident .
Two days before , her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to divorce . Maria was so upset that she could n't keep it to herself .
They could not believe their eyes .
Maria had bought his favourite food and she threw it into the bin .
She went to school , but she could not follow the lessons as easily as she used to .
Moreover , the theatre restaurant was closed for maintenance .
In addition , I can go to Britain by plane to see her .
When I received your letter , I could not believe it .
Unfortunately , I will only be able to go in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for that month .
I am in doubt as to what kind of clothes I have to bring with me .
I had the best experience in my life .
Can you guess who they chose for the job , " me " , yes , me , I could n't believe it .
My job basically was to , before and after the actuation , make everything ready .
To be honest the most exciting part of all this was getting to know the group .
Yours Sincerely ,
First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the concert would take place .
I am writing to you to " help " you with your festival next year . Last year was n't very good so maybe we can make it more attractive this year .
First , I think we should rent bigger halls so that we can make a better sound and give more space for the audience !
We can invite stars and artists from around the world who will play and presentspresent all kinds of music like jazz , rock , classical etc .
Afterwards we could let people talk with the artists so they could get to know them personally .
If you want to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it please contact me on my cellphone .
Yours sincerely
First of all , it depends what kind of school it is :
Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have fewer practical lessons , and sometimes it 's hard to get books or other things needed for studying .
School is supposed to be our second home but it 's not . We work hard and at the end of our education we still have nothing .
I would make schools less stressful , with added fun 'cause that way it 's easier to learn and I would give students more chances to share their fantasies at school .
Maybe the Polish system is not bad , but it 's comfortable too .
I know that this letter will not change anything but you can see how complicated a Polish student 's life is .
I 'm not sure about the weather in California in the daytime and in the nighttime .
Thank you very much for your offer .
From my point of view , your organisation has to be careful to organise an activity .
It was unpleasant for me to see different actors on the stage .
In the advertisement that I received , it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept waiting for it to start for half an hour .
I am writing to you about my complaints about the musical show at your theatre that I watched a week ago , during my stay in London .
Another problem was the male actor who starred : the well - known and talented actor mentioned in the advertisement was replaced by another one , who was really very disappointing and after the performance , I visited the theatre restaurant , which was supposed to be open and available for meals after the show , but it was closed .
I appreciated this big news .
I am very keen on photography so I definitely will choose this as one of my activities at the camp .
I have got some experience already and I 'm used to any weather conditions , furthermore I simply love water sports and their challenges .
My tasks were very specific .
Its name is " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " , and I really was impressed with the coherence of the stories .
It 's stimulating to read them .
I 'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately , and find out there are many challenges in your new career .
We are waiting for your decision and we will accept it whatever it may be .
The clearest example is to compare a house from the beginning of the 20th century with our houses . Both are very similar but now we have new technologies .
I am writing this letter to inform you that I have received your letters and I am going on the trip .
Every night I would like to go out of the small tent into the nice environment outside the tent .
I was a bit disappointed with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or second prize .
At first I was surprised but a few seconds later , when I realised that I was n't allowed to go , I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go .
I had to keep things in place and check that the microphones were working properly .
I was really embarrassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that was the very best experience I have ever had .
Tell me yours . I want to know what experiences you had when you were in England .
I would be grateful if you could include this show in your programme .
This is a great opportunity for me to explore and experience London myself , especially The London fashion and leisure shows .
Most of the shows are about fashionable things for students my age .
I think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of show , for instance latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , how to put on make - up and how to have appropriate hairstyles .
In my opinion , I think you should have this event in the afternoon instead of going shopping and move the shopping slot to the afternoon on Wednesday .
I trust you to pay immediate attention to my suggestions .
I closed my eyes , took a deep breath and jumped out of the tower .
There were hundreds of Thai students waiting to take this test .
I was very afraid of the height and was very nervous .
I was given the list of activities while I was taking part in the adventure school schemes at the soldier camps in the north of Thailand .
The last task I had to do was jump out of the high tower .
I eventually managed to complete all the tasks that I had been given and I was very proud of this .
Surprisingly the show started at 20:15 .
Of course I accepted immediately .
After school Larry and I went to the cinema , but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us .
When we arrived at the shopping centre , I saw a lot of people .
The task was not easy , at 18 you do n't know too much about cryptographic algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it . There was nothing to lose .
Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure systems and new encryption algorithms .
You should n't go shopping when the shops are so busy because it 's so annoying .
You do n't have to be a genius to notice that technology has evolved so considerably during the last few decades that our everyday life has changed .
I 'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent . And with the tent I can go to another place in the camp .
And I like painting because I like to paint nature , sea , mountains .
I want to know some information about it .
I 'm really looking forward to your answers . And I hope to see you soon .
Yours sincerely Gubin .
I abolutely agree with this .
Because I have my own experience of shopping .
For example , recently I was shopping at the market , which is located in the centre of our town .
When I was there I saw a very beautiful T - shirt .
I was upset about it .
Our government is very bureaucratic .
Our ministers are really criminal . They often break the law , stealing money .
Because of it our state ca n't pay workers in schools , hospitals , on building sites . In our country there is a high number of unemployed .
Often people ca n't buy a piece of bread . And they ask for money from other people .
I wish that my accommodation at Camp California it must be in a tent .
Anyway I enjoyed it so much .
I haven't been to a concert before so the atmosphere was really good .
Do you remember the computer course that we took together . It was very useful to classify each person at the concert .
I congratulate you because that 's perfect .
The advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook . Unfortunately there was someone else - an actor who I do not like and if I had known that he was going to be there I would not have gone to see him .
In fact , modern technology was already very popular and commonly used when I was born , so I can not say that it changed my life suddenly .
All these products of science are with me from the very beginning of my day .
On the other hand , I am aware of all the disadvantages of modern technology ; pollution and the dangers it brings .
But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my century - the age of modern science .
I am writing to answer your invitation which I have received as a first prize winner .
There are also many kinds of take - away restaurants , where I can taste my favourite foods .
But there is always a lot of traffic at all times , and the air is so polluted that I ca n't even breathe .
I always feel very tired after the shopping because of unfriendly people who are too busy .
What is more , admission for students is free .
However , we have got a suggestion : we saw an advertisement for " the London Fashion and Leisure Show " which is going to be on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 to 19:00 .
I was pleased to receive your letter recently .
Now I 'm going to give you some information you asked about .
I 'm sorry to say this , but the only time I will be able to take this trip is in July , according to our team 's schedule .
The next thing - I would prefer to spend all the nights in a tent , so I can move it to the place that will suit me best . I like to wake up with a view of mountains , which reminds me of my 5 years ' experience of climbing .
So , is it possible ? I would like to continue doing my favourite hobbies in the Camp .
Otherwise , you will either not find what you are looking for , or you will , and spend the rest of the day in a bad mood , because of the bad manners of sales people , who do not give you advice every time you ask for it .
To summarise everything , I would recommend spending less time indoors , shopping during the weekdays .
You wrote ' discounts available ' but they did n't offer any discount .
But it was unpleasant because of these things .
Owing to all of them , I can live very comfortably .
In your letter you wrote that I will have the chance to do two activities ; first of all I would like to play tennis because I have been playing for seven years . Secondly I would like to attend a surfing course but I have just some elementary knowledge .
It will be interesting to show how the lessons are organized , showing that we are never doing just one activity during the class .
After that we have to make sure that we explain about the relationship between teachers and students , showing the times that we have been out together .
Finally we should give some information also about our tourism , business and computer courses .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in a tent because I enjoy being outside close to nature .
Sometimes the bad characters in a story are more interesting than the good ones .
Its title was : " The Mystery of Hunter 's Lodge " .
The character whom I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering , the mistress .
It was very exciting because she could play two people at the same time : herself and the housekeeper .
First of all I would like to say that it started later than it should have . I had to wait for about forty - five minutes .
Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show , which was very diappointing for me because I like this actor very much , and I think that I was not the only one who was upset .
Yours sincerely ,
They are very useful things which sometimes are necessary to survive .
I watch about four hours of TV a day . I even eat my meals in front of the TV . We can see PEOPLE 'S LIFE in other countries , which is very interesting for me and my friends .
Also the Internet has an influence on my daily life , because I can find there many interesting things , or I can meet with people from all over the world , which is exciting for me .
I think that life without modern technology would be simple and boring . That 's why I am using it in my daily life . I am happy that there is such a thing as modern technology .
Finally the day to pay my credit card arrived and where was my money ?
All the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for three days .
In the morning , we will have the chance to see some of the sights of London by bus , for example , the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery .
The reason I write to you is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , for a few days .
The show is free for students and we can see the show instead of having free time on Wednesday in the afternoon .
Nowadays , with the help of the media , famous people , like politicians or filmstars , play an important role in our community .
Who got married , who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion , these are questions that most journalists are interested in .
There were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement .
In the advertisement it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play the main roles .
The advertisement said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 .
The advertisement said that they would be available but they were not .
It was written in the advertisement that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show , but unfortunately it was closed .
We build big cities , there is hot and cold water , electricity , gas in practically every home .
Many different incurable diseases have appeared .
I 'm writing with reference to your letter . I was really thrilled , when I found out that I won first prize in your competition . I always dreamed about going to California and now my dreams are coming true .
I 've always wanted to learn to sing professionally , but I 've never had an opportunity .
When she tried to answer me , one small child took her picture with a flash .
Truly , my work here was n't very important , but I really enjoyed it .
I 'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in London .
So I 'm writing this letter , asking if you can change the programme .
There is a great opportunity to go there because students need not pay anything .
Our first challenge was stealing Dick 's girlfriend 's panties , but we failed .
Nick and Dick could prove their bravery stealing their mother 's panties .
" It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it " , to prove my bravery to everyone .
I USUALLY SWIM THREE TIMES A WEEK IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A BACK TREATMENT WHICH MY DOCTOR HAS RECOMMENDED ME TO FOLLOW .
SO , IF POSSIBLE , I WAS INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING MY ROUTINE THERE .
LASTLY , I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME IF I HAVE TO BRING SOME MONEY WITH ME TO BUY FOOD OR DRINKS AND HOW THE CLIMATE OF THE CAMPING AREA IS SO I CAN PACK MY LUGGAGE , BRINGING ONLY THE APPROPRIATE CLOTHES .
THIS BOOK CONTAINED NINE STORIES WHICH WERE WRITTEN BY WELL - KNOWN WRITERS LIKE RAY BRADBURY .
BUT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE BOOK IS TO ALLOW YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR IMAGINATION AND TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF HOW LIFE IS GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE , WHEN , PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL BE RULED BY MACHINES .
SO , IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A " REALLY SPLENDID SCIENCE FICTION BOOK " I WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO READ " A WINDOW .. " AND I'M SURE THAT WHEN YOU FINISH READING IT YOU WILL WANT TO READ IT AGAIN , AND AGAIN ... !
I would like to ask whether you have competitions or different activities .
Do you recommend me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well ?
I worked until midnight every day .
It was very enjoyable . I made lots of friends . We were together all day , painting the walls , cleaning and putting up some balloons and other stuff everywhere .
Famous people must understand that the journalists are doing their job .
Second , regarding accommodation , I 'd like to stay in a log cabin .
I also want to know if I should take any money , or if all the expenses are paid by you .
That makes those people frustrated and they do n't enjoy themselves .
Regarding accommodation in tents or log cabins , I would enjoy much more being in a tent as I believe that is the right type of accommodation for going camping .
Men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as their favourite pastime .
Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes . However , do we really like the process of choosing them ?
I 'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organised last 21 and 22 of November .
The festival was very well organised with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
In my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small . You have to consider booking a bigger one for next year because these kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people .
At school it is completely different because the teachers do n't forgive you anything .
I would n't like to change anything because we all need some discipline to do the right things .
At first my favourite actor Danny Brook did n't perform , without any explanations being given , and the show should have started at 19:30 instead of 20:15 ! !
I was sure that discounts were available because I had read that they were , but at the ticket office they did n't offer them .
All this story was a secret but Pat revealed it to his mother .
I am writing to you because I am really disappointed about " Over the Rainbow " which I saw the other day during my stay in London which your company organized .
I explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and I want you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happened there .
Yours faithfully
If we create guns to protect our homes , others will use them to burgle our homes , and take advantage of the defenceless people .
Because I have had experience of staying in a tent and I like it very much .
In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever played .
I have just finished a professional photography course and I would like to continue my education in this activity .
I was shocked because I had already spoken with them and I had got two autographs .
Another part of my experience at the pop concert when we meet each other .
First of all , the actors mentioned in the advertisement were not those who performed in the show .
Plus , it is mentioned in your advertisement that discounts are available . In fact , no discount was given to me , though I am a student and as a student I was entitled to get a discount but I paid £ 20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show .
As a student , the low priced ticket certainly attracted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists .
Finally , I would like to make one big suggestion : you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way do n't have to spend money on accommodation .
Furthermore , department stores are always looking for students who would like to work .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is an amazing show because there are parades with the latest fashions . We could see some famous top models . Also there will be a variety of clothes either sports wear as elegant designs .
I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it , when a shower of stones covered the entrance of the hole .
I walked alone a long distance until I found a telephone . I called the police and they ask for a rescue .
When we finished at our primary school we went to the same secondary school too , but we were in different classes .
And when we finished at the secondary school , I decided go to a foreign University .
In my opinion , the clothes will be more colourful , fun and comfortable .
People will prefer to wear comfortable clothes , even to go to the office .
Actually , I think that the clothes will be really simple in 100 years and I hope to be alive until then .
However , when I saw it , I was really disappointed and I must ask you for some money back .
First of all , Danny Brook was not there . I was very upset because he is my favourite singer and that was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this show .
On the development , they also said that there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty - five years old but that was totally wrong because I paid the full price , which was £ 20 .
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow " .
Regarding the times of the performance , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 . Nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenery .
I was waiting for 45 minutes .
You can send a letter to your friend by e - mail instead of writing it on a piece of paper and sending it by post .
After that " show " we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurant but what a surprise !
Let 's take the mobile phone .
Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is " mobile " .
I 'm writing this letter to complain about your fake advertisement .
First of all , in your show advertisement it says that Danny Brooks stars in the play .
In the evenings before I go to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV via satellite .
When I go to bed , because there are many mosquitoes , I turn on a special machine with a battery - like thing in it which kills them .
I believe that modern technology has positively affected our lives .
In order to fulfil their readers ' requirements they constantly follow them .
On the other hand , famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures , because although they are famous they also have their private life .
Your programme is very good , especially as we can go to visit the Science Museum , which I heard is very good , but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles and it is free for students too .
I climbed up the tree .
It was badly hurt . My friend rushed to me , then ran back to my house and called Mum .
Mum came in , looking very angry . I prayed for a short conversation .
I want to complain about your advertisement for the production ' Over the Rainbow ' ; I had a very disappointing evening .
Yesterday when I arrived at college , I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strangely at me and laughing .
People started to write things on the board and to point at me .
It is a great failing of responsibility for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one .
Finally , the restaurant where I would have liked to have dinner with friends after the show was closed , contrary to what was announced in the advertisement .
I 'm writing to answer your questions but , first of all , to thank you for the prize .
I would like to travel in July because it is the school holiday here in Portugal and I will have the entire month to travel , so I have no preference for which weeks .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your letter .
I have to say that I am really disappointed with your advertisement because you mentioned some points that are not true .
Secondly , another problem was the starting time . According to your advertisement , the play starts at 19.30 but instead it started at 20:15 , this is almost an hour 's delay .
The simplest example of modern high technology is the introduction of the computer - better known as the PC .
Research has shown that almost every single household owns a PC . Some people use them for their job because they need it , but others , like children , use it just for fun .
Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the TV , the microwave , the video , the satellite dish , the CD player and hundreds of others .
All these play an important role in our daily life without us ever understanding them .
Those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable , but they take us away from our friends , our families and moreover they lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything that surrounds us and keeps us alive .
I think that is going to be more comfortable for me due to the fact that I am very sensitive to changes of temperature and I ca n't take the risk of catching a cold because , as you know , I 'm going to start to work .
How are you ? I 'm fine and I am writing to you because I know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert ; I have to tell you that I did help there and it was very hard work . You ca n't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert .
I am writing to you to complain about the last Saturday evening performance at your theatre .
Finally , I want to know what the weather is like in California in July .
The teacher uses video and pictures to teach students about festivals , sports , museums , etc .
Basketball is the most popular activity , which takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week .
I have received your letter and I am so glad I have won the first prize .
I have been playing tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16 's U.S open tournament last summer .
I 'm writing to complain about your theatre and its show last night .
Firstly I would like to say that I was very disappointed with the show and that I did n't have the perfect evening out , as advertised .
The main character of the musical show , who I 'd like to say was n't the " BEST " , was awful .
And then , when I arrived at the theatre , I expected to have a discount but unfortunately I did n't .
On top of all this , the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef and the waiters were on holiday .
I was very disappointed , what else can I say .
It was supposed to be my perfect evening out .
In conclusion , I 'd like to recommend that you should first know what you have to offer and then advertise it .
Yours sincerely
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I should n't have told her that my dad had psychological problems .
All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accident .
When one day Pat came over to my house , we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up .
Pat started shouting and screaming , saying what was really going on .
Also with weekend shopping , you ca n't find somewhere to sit down comfortably to have a cup of tea .
According to your advertisement , it stars DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE , but surprisingly , was performed by a different actor of whom I did n't even know the name .
Nowadays , we use a lot of modern technology both at home and in the office but it has its advantages and disadvantages .
The first and most important thing is that modern technology has made our life easier , for instance the rice cooker is a great invention , all you have to do is put rice in it and switch it on , it makes cooking more efficient .
Furthermore , we use the computer and telephone a lot .
Mankind became more and more clever and built wonderful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands .
Although there are new machines etc , medicine makes many discoveries thanks to research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer .
I have won the first prize ! I am extremely happy about this .
I can only take a holiday in July because I am going to start a new education at the beginning of August .
Staying in a tent will remind me of an unforgettable time .
Given the circumstances , I would like to learn more about photography and painting .
Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I take travellers ' cheques ?
I applied for a job at the ticket office because I hoped to see a lot of different people .
I had to prepare the ingredients for every meal .
That meant I had to read the recipes very carefully .
I am writing to you to complain about the show " Over the Rainbow " at your theatre " The Circle Theatre " .
I am deeply disappointed with the service and the unreliable information at your theatre .
I am very disappointed by this .
You also mention that your show would start at 19.30 but to my knowledge it started at 20:15 and that meant forty - five minutes of waiting .
It also mentioned other services would be available to the audience .
For Example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show , when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance .
And I would like a refund . You have wasted my evening and money .
Synthetics have been created by scientists .
Clothes are now mass - produced and designed by designers .
Designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes .
It is hard to imagine what people will wear in 100 years ' time , because since the 1900s clothes have reduce into smaller item and more practical .
Maybe it would continue reducing in 100 years to come .
Scientists might discover a new way to make clothes more fixalde .
It would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choose what you want to wear by pressing buttons .
This would be very easy to manage but it would mean no more shopping for girls .
It would be scary to live in the new 100 years , but it would be interesting to see what will happen .
The next thing is that I would prefer a log cabin .
I was responsible for the advertisements and I also had to invite the " important people " from our government .
It was really a new job for me , but I think I did well .
There were two other problems : there were no discounts , contrary to the information in the advertisement , and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repair work .
However , she definitely deserved to have a private life as a citizen .
Thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition . I also want to congratulate you on your excellent competition , thanks to which I have the opportunity to go to California , a place that I always wanted to go to .
About the trip , I think it would be preferable to do it in July , which is a holiday period and so I wo n't have any special obligations .
Spending a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worst thing to do , especially during a holiday !
Any little tournaments of this kind would be great .
Moreover instead of buying a ticket I went there for free , as a helper .
The pop concert was excellent and I had a lot of fun .
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOUR THEATRE PUT ON .
I WENT TO YOUR THEATRE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A GREAT TIME . UNFORTUNATELY , THINGS WENT VERY WRONG .
SECONDLY , THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO START AT HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE AFTERNOON , BUT IT STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT ,
THAT IS FORTY - FIVE MINUTES LATER ! IT IS ALSO ADVERTISED THAT THERE WERE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE . HOWEVER , THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE .
LASTLY , AFTER THAT AWFUL EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT , OF COURSE , I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .
UNFORTUNATELY , PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS AND I DISCOVERED THAT TOO LATE .
THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWING FRIDAY , WHICH WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS .
Dear Mr. manager of The Circle Theatre :
Could you , if we may ask , reorganise our visit to the museum and also to the shopping centre .
Perhaps we could spend our free time at the museum before going to the shopping centre .
Whatever you do , journalists should not follow you every second .
The problem is that most of the advertisement was misleading .
But the main reason for my complaint , is that in the advertisement it was said it would be my perfect evening out , and it was not .
And the best thing is that it entertains me alone or with people .
I have just received your letter and I thank you for your invitation and congratulations .
As regards accommodation , I prefer a longer , Canadian tent in a quiet place because I am fond of nature and I would like to feel free in an informal setting .
I like competitive and challenging sports . I enjoy comparing my skill with other players and , if possible , I would rather not do indoor sports activities , but open air ones .
I have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy .
The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good at explaining problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject .
Also the sports activities should be filmed ; they express an aggregative and social way of living school life and can be useful to show the movements of the bodies during the school athletics events .
The dancing lessons should also be filmed , especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their movements .
We were interested in seeing the actors that appeared on the tickets and I was very disappointed when , in the show , we saw other actors .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
I have just received your letter and I 'm very happy because of it , especially because the competition was so hard .
Being at Camp California was one of the dreams of my life and now I can realise it .
However , about accommodation , I 'd prefer a log cabin , because it is more comfortable than a tent .
Firstly , I was very embarrassed during the concert , but all the staff were very kind to me and Tom too .
THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS THE HISTORY OF WORLD CONQUEST . THAT SAID , TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MAN 'S EVOLUTION . FURTHERMORE , DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES , THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOSION . WHILE THE XIX CENTURY GAVE US THE STEAM ENGINE , FACTORIES AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB , THIS CENTURY HAS GIVEN US NUCLEAR ENERGY ( AND SADLY ATOMIC WEAPONS ) , THE COMPUTER , THE INTERNET AND TELEVISION .
I 'd like to tell you that the best month for me to travel to the U.S.A . is July because I will be on holiday in that month .
I do n't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California , but if I can tell you which one I prefer I 'll choose to stay in a tent .
The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out . Marvellous !
Two days before I read an advertisement for this show , which said that Danny Brook was starring .
Apart from that , the show started at 20:15 , not at 19:30 , as it said in the advertisement and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished .
When I went to my bedroom I realised that Pat had told my mother about the party , because no one else knew that my mother did not know that .
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show , the name of which is Over the Rainbow , which I saw in your theatre recently .
It was a pity but it did not annoy me because I thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 for .
After the show I decided to go to have a coffee and to smoke a cigarette to try to calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the barman 's day off .
I am very indignant because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you to return my money and take note of all these problems .
Maybe it would be a nice idea to analyse these changes and to put limits on technology , because I think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it .
Firstly , the show did not start on time but forty - five minutes late .
This actor was not nearly as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paid so much money if I had known this before .
The worst thing of all was that at the beginning of the show I realized that the actors were totally different from the ones advertised .
They were worse than the previous actors .
They believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because they will be outgoing , amusing , etc .
And people will wear cybernetic clothes but at the same time comfortable clothes .
I received your letter recently , and I am really happy to learn that I have won the first prize .
About the accommodation during those two weeks , I would rather stay in a log cabin , as it is really difficult for me to stay in a little close room .
I had an induction climbing course two years ago , and I still climb regularly . I can do a V+ level climb .
Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular . The shopping centres are always busy , with people going up and down carrying bags and looking in shop windows ; it seems everybody is happy .
To sum up , shopping is not always enjoyable , but do n't worry , the shopping centre is still there waiting for you !
I can only travel in July because this is the month when I have holidays .
I 've already talked to my manager , and she said that that 's the only month I can have my holidays .
I 've been playing tennis since I was seven , and I 've been studying how to play tennis for a very long time , nine years .
You know how good I am at music Anyway I was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds . At the beginning I was connecting all these wires into speakers , music system , guitars etc ... The bit that I particularly liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar - you know how much I love playing guitar - and all these video cameras were just filming us .
I asked one of the cameramen when they 're going to show this show on tv , and he told me they 're going to show it on the 10 of June , so turn on your tv on this date , channel three , and you will see me there playing this guitar . AH , it was lovely .
What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebrities .
I particularly liked listening to their musicians when they played the piano , clarinet , drums , violin etc .
Pat promised not to speak to anyone about the car , but one evening Philip overhead her speaking about this with her boyfriend : " It will be delivered on Thursday !
Furthermore , the show started at 20:15 while the advertisement said that it was going to begin at 19:30 .
I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all the promises that were made in the advertisement .
Of course , what was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening , and I would be very grateful if you could refund me the price of my ticket .
Scientists will invent new materials that will keep the body 's temperature in a suitable range .
For that reason clothes will be simpler and more practical .
Of course , the resources used and the manufacturing will be completely harmless for the environment because people will be more aware of the necessity of taking care of the world we live in .
And it 's all the more tiring since you often wait for two weeks before getting it .
I think that this tendency will not change but what will change is life .
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisement , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and make some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take into consideration .
In your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world , unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented .
The night he came into this world was one of grater for the inhabitants of the country and also of the town where he was born , it was an ordinary night .
To begin with , according to your advertisement , discount tickets are available .
The tickets were rather expensive , and the discounts mentioned in the advertisement were n't at all available at the theatre .
Pat was my friend , I trusted her and we got on very well until she repeated to everyone the secret I had told her .
Regarding accommodation I 'd prefer to sleep in a tent because I like being outside and hearing the noises of the sea .
a maths lesson , an English lesson , a swimming lesson , the break and the staff room .
- We could show the activities of the students during the break . For example , students who play football or volleyball .
We could find out what this room is like and what the teachers do in this mysterious room .
I can be closer to nature and I have never used tents before .
My parents were very proud of me .
My hands were trembling but I did it very well .
I 'd like to say something that I felt during the festival , and give my opinions that would be helpful for you to prepare for the next festival .
People believe that the bird was sent from heaven .
So I am going to ask for a refund ... I hope this is n't offending you too much ...
When it comes down to colour , I think it 'll be much brighter and maybe glittery .
Colours to match the clothes .
First of all , I would like to thank you for doing such a good job organising the competition which I luckily won . I have been really very impressed .
In fact I will finish my university exams only on the first of July and after the 20th it is impossible because I am going to do four weeks ' voluntary work in India for UNICEF .
If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollen .
Thank you very much for your attention on my behalf
Why have so many people been infected by this " psychological virus " ?
We are always trying to have more things , which lead us to neglect our family , our future , and other things which are probably more important than a new perfume .
Maybe you think I am exaggerating but recent studies prove that this mania can be really dangerous .
Certainly only the fact of having something can help people to be more sure of themselves .
Probably when Oscar Wilde said : " Superficiality is the supreme vice " he was right .
You can not imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work ; as a matter of fact , after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast - food restaurant .
She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any hesitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen .
I have just received the letter , which lets me know that I have won the first prize .
This is because I intend to take an examination in September .
And recently , I have been practising tennis as a school activity .
The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist during setting chairs just before they started practising .
Can you send me a letter back writing what happened to you recently ?
Finally , what kind of weather is waiting for us ?
Surprisingly , there were no discounts .
She just remembered it ought to be a secret , and she became really embarrassed .
I swim really well and I am a professional basketball player .
It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him at a concert of my favourite band .
I am writing to you about the show .
The woman who sold me a ticket was very rude to me , actually she started swearing at me .
They were just playing and , by accident , Peter shot him .
He promised to keep it secret . The next morning we had an argument with Pat . The 3 of us were shouting at each other . In short , Pat left us .
Secondly , I am interested in trying something that I have never done , so I would like to do sailing .
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a great success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price .
I am writing with regard to your advertisement .
It was my favourite musical .
I was very hopeful that I was going to have a good time .
The worst thing is that I could n't see my favourite actor .
I was so disappointed about that .
I could n't concentrate on the play any more .
In contrast to the advertisement everything was disappointing .
These days we can use a computer , television and some sophisticated equipment , which were unusual once .
Children play with computers instead of the usual toys .
There has been a change in the relationships between people .
We have noticed the environmental damage in recent years .
I think this festival is a great idea because it 's an opportunity to see and to appreciate art , but I also think there are some things that could be changed .
I noticed that the artists were from only six countries instead that from around the world .
This choice does n't give many artists the opportunity to express themselves .
I hope that my opinion can help you to organize for next year a great international arts festival alone to young people .
I am writing to complain about a musical show on the 10th of June , and I was very disappointed .
I was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw another star that was completely different from your brochure .
According to your brochure , the show would start at 19.30 p.m. but it started at 20.15 p.m. I wanted to sleep and it was very annoying .
I was promised that after the show I could go to the theatre restaurant but due to the show starting late it also finished late , therefore , when I went to the restaurant they were definitely closed .
I have a really good friend , Pat who I trusted and counted on .
One day , I fell in love with my closest friend .
We were studying in the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well .
Personally , I wanted to keep it secret because I was afraid that we might split up .
And I would like to make sure that he really loved me .
My boyfriend told me that he wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the time came .
One day I decided to tell my best friend - Pat , who I relied on .
I told her everything about my boyfriend and when we met each other and eventually fell in love .
On Monday morning , I walked into the class and all of my friends were shouting at me and calling my name and my boyfriend .
I was very embarrassed and I wanted to run out of the class .
I received your letter and I am very excited about the camp .
I would like to go in July , I do n't mind which two weeks , but it has to be that month because in June I am still in school and in August I am going on holiday with my family .
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it 's different from where I sleep every night so I would appreciate it if there are still tents available .
Here is where the good part starts , I was doing the curtains ( opening and closing ) when Nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him . My heart started beating very hard .
DANNY BROOK is one of my favourite actors so I decided to buy a ticket even though I had to cancel my appointment on that day at 18.30 and also notice of price discount impressed me .
However , when I got to the theatre , you not only did n't have any discounts but also had to apologize to us for the delay in starting the musical .
In addition a different actor appeared on the stage and I could n't have dinner after the musical because the restaurant was closed .
It made me so disappointed and angry .
You should return my money immediately because that night was far from perfect .
When all the money had gone from a bank , nobody was there except Pat .
Then the police realized who the bank robbers were and arrested them .
I 'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter , so referring to the question of when I would like to travel , I would like to go anytime during July , because I have to be back home in August , because I need to apply and get everything sorted out , to go to college next September .
And referring to the question about which type of accommodation I prefer , I choose a log cabin , because I think that a tent is messier , so I would appreciate it if you give me a cabin .
And my answer to the question about which activities I would like to choose , well I choose swimming , because it is my daily exercise , and surfing .
And well , Mrs Helen , I would really appreciate it if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions .
Yours truly
Well here in Dublin things are still the same , but I think somebody told you that I went to the Moby concert here at the Point , which is the big venue for events and concerts . I guess it was the best concert I 've ever been to , but the coolest thing is that , well do you remember my friend Luke , the one that works as a security guard ? Well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage , so I went to help them and everything else , and when I got to the Point , do you know who was there ?
Can you believe it , it was Moby . So I went to say hello to him , and he asked me , ' Would you give me a hand with my decks ? ' So I went , and when we finished he gave me a T - shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row . Oh my God , Kim , that was the best thing that ever happened to me . Well Kim , I hope to receive a letter from you soon , and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything , thank you .
It is wonderful for me to have the opportunity to visit Camp California in the U.S.A.
I think this topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view , because we can study the subject 's reactions before , during and after shopping .
For men and women appearance is important and they spend a lot of money buying clothes , cosmetics , accessories , jewellery etc .
I think in the near future we need to decide with the government
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area , but of course with all the facilities to get there , like a big supermarket and mall centre , from different areas of the city .
IN ADDITION TO THIS , I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET .
Firstly , the actor was supposed to be Danny Brook , but he was not , it was another actor , who I have never seen before , so , as you can imagine , I was very disappointed .
Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she had done , but Pat refused to apologise to her , because she felt it was n't a mistake and she did it for only one reason : to help Maria to get the man that she loved .
First of all , we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderful trip with an interesting programme .
It is a coincidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage of .
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have autographs from .
I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for autographs .
It may , in many cases , not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately connected to it .
The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Festival I attended last weekend .
Firstly , I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic , but in your advertisement it said that I would find stars and artists from around the world , when , in fact , they were from only six countries .
Secondly , I believe you should know that a lot of people , including me , were not able to enjoy the concerts because some concert halls were too small .
Last but not least , I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separately .
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilities we will be using .
This is because people wo n't give up the great taste of food . Although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two .
Lastly , I think that all these changes wo n't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptly .
Some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing , that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .
I believe that if somebody wants fame and glory he must be totally clear about the results .
Another successful career such as , film stars must also be balanced .
If somebody wants to be famous of course they must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her .
It does n't matter what kind of career or job you have .
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you for the great opportunity you are giving us , especially in planning all this programme in such an accurate way .
Also , this show is free ( another positive point ) .
I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars into aeroplanes ...
In conclusion , I strongly believe that the house of the future will be the house of a new awareness . It will be a very positive point for opening up our lives .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology .
Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their lives have been far easier than before .
I was enthusiastic about receiving your letter . I will give you all the necessary information .
You ca n't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert . Apart from the musicians and the singers , there are people who work with lights , who organize the security ... it was so exciting !
I 've received your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax and to leave the city , which is very stressful .
I can travel in July only because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it 's the month he can give me one , so I hope that is n't a problem for you .
I would prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent , that 's , in my opinion , a way to be nearer the environment and the animals , although I do n't mind staying in log cabins .
To sum up , everything you do in small quantities is good and fun , but do n't increase the amount you do if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .
Well my friend , I have to go , because I have got an appointment with the Dentist .
How much money do you recommend me to bring with me ?
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsy .
I had to buy my dress , its accessories and also clothes and souvenirs !
Thank you for choosing our ticket at the final .
It would be great if we could choose swimming and golf .
Finally , we would like to know when you will send us the airline tickets and the brochure .
You are interested in my last job ! I really want to tell you all about my experience .
In addition , it was nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and hundreds of Coblights in the right place .
Finally , we worked the whole night before the concert .
We had to adjust the laser extremely carefully to get it in the correct position .
Finally you said there was a Restaurant , but it was closed , so we could n't eat anything until we got home .
I have chosen these activities because these days I am playing on the university team , and photography is my favourite hobby .
Is it necessary to bring any money ?
I am writing to you to tell you about my experience at a pop concert .
It began when our mutual friend Martha offered me the chance to help organise the concert . Obviously I accepted .
Now I can tell you that it was an amazing challenge for me because I had never done anything like that .
My duties as a staff member were various . The first day I had to pick the bands up from the airport , and for this I hired a van .
I am very disappointed because the things that were written in the advertisement were not really true .
It was written that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Danny Brook is one of my favourite actors and there appeared a different one .
I felt very disappointed .
The musical should have begun at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 ; this is unacceptable !
As you say in your advertisement , it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back .
On the other hand , the main disadvantage is that using modern machines can be very difficult for elderly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries trained people to use modern technologies .
I 'm writing to you to thank you for the excellent programme for our English class in London , especially for the river trip to Greenwich . It will be a great experience for us .
But the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " , which will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall , London , on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 . At the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show .
Please let us know as soon as you make your decision .
This book helps us to improve our logic , mind , and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie , to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much .
In fact , shopping can have some disadvantages for different reasons :
It became essential to doing my homework .
The place I 'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin , where I 'm sure I 'd feel more comfortable than in a tent .
I think I 'm not bad at painting either ; at least everyone in my family likes my work , including myself .
If it is possible I want a log cabin for my accommodation because I have been suffering with my back since my childhood , therefore I need a comfortable place to sleep .
I selected swimming because it is a cure for my backache and I have not done it since I started my new job five years ago .
On the other hand , shopping can be unenjoyable .
Peter and Sue asked Francis for some help with their exam subjects and Francis , all week , was too busy to help them .
I looked at her and she became pale and suddenly left the class .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London . It will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
So , it would be great if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
At that time he was unconscious . I kept asking myself ' Should I wake him up or try to use my dubious first aid skills to help with him . "
Can you please give me some recommendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget .
I start thinking about what she or he prefers and I try my best to buy something appropriate no matter how much money it costs .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depending on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing .
I AM WRITING WITH REFERENCE TO THE LONDON TRIP WE ARE MAKING VERY SOON .
WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SHOW .
WE THINK IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY , BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW , WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF SHOW IN THIS CITY .
IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAMME , WE SUGGEST GOING TO THE SHOW ON TUESDAY AND ON WEDNESDAY , INSTEAD OF FREE TIME , VISITING THE SCIENCE MUSEUM .
YOURS SINCERELY ,
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE AREA VERY WELL BECAUSE ALL THE TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF AT THE CORNER OF MY STREET . BUT THAT DAY , AS I WAS KIND OF DRUNK , I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE . SO , WHEN I NOTICED IT , THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF , BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO .
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS , BUT HE JUST SAID SORRY .
I WAS REALLY SCARED .
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUND BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ASK THEM THE WAY .
AFTER FILLOWING HIM FOR 10 MINUTES , I STARTED TO RECOGNISE THE PLACE , AND I WAS FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE .
Definitely , it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate it if it is possible to have my money back .
I thought that Dany Brook , who is my favourite actor , would perform in that show .
Please , if you would be so kind correct this mistake . I would be grateful if you could correct too that show starts at 20.15 not on 19.30 .
Another thing was that there were no discounts available , and that the restaurant , which I wanted to visit after the show , was closed because of the main cook sickness .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I knew that he 's a very talkative person , but it was necessary because I wanted him to be the main organiser of that birthday party for tenes .
I made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha 's friends with a note : " Do not tell Agatha about this . This is a surprise party for her . Please keep the secret ! " Pat arranged a great DJ and drinks .
My friend and I made the perfect decorations with balloons and other party stuff .
It was so exciting ! ! !
Anyway the disco was great , music also .
And your last festival was very interesting too .
But also there are some notes that you should improve in next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
I think that one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it is n't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event , and with this ticket you can visit everything you want .
So the main rule in our school is regarding teachers .
I have chosen as my activities surfing and photography .
How is the weather in California ?
Afterwards , I felt tired and unsatisfied with the store .
I 'm very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
I can come to USA in July because in August I will be working with my father .
You offer a great variety of activities .
I have questions too .
People always queued for stuff from the west .
Nowadays we have capitalism , free market , lots of private shops , markets and supermarkets .
They are imported from another Western European country .
I appreciate these shops for lots of products , cheap prices and big spaces .
On Friday evening and on the weekdays all supermarkets are crowded .
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you told me I have won first prize in your competition .
Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know some further information about travel and accommodation .
For instance , it is fun to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a T - shirt although you do not buy anything .
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED . I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE OVER ALL . REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY .
PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING ( ESPECIALLY IN POLAND , WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED ) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HYPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS , MOTORBIKES OR COMPUTERS .
ANYWAY EVERYBODY SHOULD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT , NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE .
Furthermore , I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fascination for art and enjoy taking photographs of wildlife .
Sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time , but I 've got a good excuse !
What a surprise ! And unbelievably , I was responsible for looking after the pop stars .
But , I got through it . I had to take care of them during the break , serving drinks , clothes , I even brought them some cigarettes and anything they wanted .
What I most appreciated was that they gave me their latest CD with their signatures . Marvellous thing ! And of course , as you have seen , I 've given one to you .
I 'm sorry but I am very disappointed with the show .
We arrived on time but the show was delayed until half - past eight .
Moreover , we were n't given any discount for being students .
Maybe the reason for that is very simple : lack of money ?
It may sound funny , but mud , gravel and snow lying on the school floors is not a nice sight , so we change our shoes without questioning that rule .
Also , in August I will be studying a summer course in English .
Also , I felt wonderful when I saw that the concert was a success and every day it was crowded .
All the students would be very grateful .
We call home the place where we live or the country where we come from .
Working long hours , doing plenty of activities , going out , going on holidays .
Probably in the future we may be too busy to go to our own home and spend some time there .
Finally , we went to the restaurant in your theatre after the show .
It was closed because of the staff training .
It is believed that our lifestyle has been changed by modern technology such as computers and washing machines etc .
First of all , dishwashers are very convenient for me because I work full - time and look after my children .
In my opinion , modern technology makes our life easier .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . That was why our great plan for our holiday was not be real .
It happened last summer . We planned to go on holiday in the southern part of Thailand by motorbike but we could n't tell our parents because they would n't allow us to go .
While I was standing on the beach , suddenly I heard someone call my name and say that I had to go home . That is right , it was my mum .
I am writing in reply to your letter I received yesterday .
' As I have a choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions .
Last year I took part in a photographer 's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the category of , , beautiful scenery '' .
But you could give me a chance to get more familiar with it .
Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want , looking through shelves and not finding that in the end .
Moreover , you could face an aggressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager .
These are some points I want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities .
It was so boring to wait for the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
It was the most imperfect evening out I ever experienced .
It took quite a long time to adjust to the multi culture in the language institute .
Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together on the weekend usually .
And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afternoon .
I am writing to thank you for your letter confirming that I won the first prize in your competition .
But I have finally got around to writing and you 'll see that it 's definitely been worth waiting for as I have some great and unbelievable news to tell you .
You will see why I 'm describing it as the most unforgettable one when you read through my letter .
She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge concert by a singer who is a well - known pop star as well as my favourite .
Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget throughout my whole life
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacy the media has to respect that .
Second , the show started at 20:15 , although I read that it would start at 19:30 !
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
When Thomas Adison invented electric light , it was the greatest invention for people of that century .
I mean , almost everyone now has a car , a computer , a mobile phone and even an airplane .
Cooking has become faster with the help of the microwave .
They become lazy because they know that they can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button .
This would be a great opportunity for us because we are all interested in clothes , sports and fashion .
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective , and he finally solves the mystery .
And another question is what are the prices of things like there , which I want to know so that I can make a better budget for my trip .
The place where we worked was a football pitch ; we spent 3 days setting up the stage , the equipment , and the lights .
I only put the speakers in the right places , or helped the engineers test the lights .
But in the breaks and after work , I had a chance to talk with the engineers , and I learnt something about setting up the equipment .
Finally , the day of the concert came .
After the concert finished successfully , I was happier than ever because the success included my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life .
According to your advertisement , the stars were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE .
I decided to go to see this show because of its stars , but on the day I saw it , a different actor performed .
Before using e - mail , I used to write letters and sometimes used the telephone .
Secondly the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes doing nothing .
If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago , you 'll notice that there are incredibly big differences between them .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scary .
There was no discount at all , which was in contrast with ' Discounts Available ' .
Concerning the fashion of the future , I think it depends on people 's personalities and they develop their own styles which suit them the most .
As for the colours , I think metallic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .
As different kinds of fabrics will be invented and the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen .
Maybe paper can also be a fabric used to make clothing and for those who like to wear new clothes every day .
While I 'm staying there I would like to practise tennis and basketball , as I have been playing both sports all my life , and I have to say that I am very good at both .
And that is always what we want .
A huge queue that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out .
I 'm writing to you inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I went to your theatre to see the play called " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
According to the advertisement you published , there should have been some important differences to the production I saw .
Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theatre to cheat your customers . If you do that , there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them .
I look forward to hearing from you
Emilio Almodar , 18 years old , University Student , and the career I have chosen is in International Commerce or Market .
In addition to this we use the net to communicate with some friends we have in the U.S.A. It 's really amazing .
Maybe some people will be naked .
Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of weather do you have in California ?
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you , no one to talk to and no one to complain to .
That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in small stores , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complain about .
I am writing in reply to your letter . I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because I have got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months I will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in these months .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a tent because it is more appropriate to a camp .
And regarding the activities , I must choose Photography and Painting because I am not very good at sports and I think I do well at these things .
Here I am , writing to you to tell you everything about my wonderful experience at the concert .
When the concert started , I was preparing some drinks for the band because after the concert they would be very tired and thirsty .
In order to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the city , the County Council organised an open air concert .
Although I was very nervous , I knew I could do the job well .
I am writing to express my disappointment with the play " over the rainbow " , which is showing at the Circle Theatre .
Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an aggressive employee refused to answer me .
Definitely , I want my money back as soon as possible .
So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and extremely aggressive .
But , well , the unhappiness started with Pat and my revealed secrets .
Organise your shows better and do not exaggerate with publicity !
Despite this , I 'm convinced all this progress has caused some damage to the community , not only physically .
Finally , everyone should slow down his own life 's rhythm .
Second of all , the play was supposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
To finish my " marvellous " evening , I wanted to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .
I was punished , nearly expelled , but Pat did n't receive any punishment .
According to your advertisement I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all .
One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook 's participation .
To make matters worse , the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisement was closed .
So I did n't have such a perfect evening as was promised in your advertisement .
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and I would be greatful if you could give me back a part of my money .
On the one hand , the Internet is often used for entertainment , but on the other hand it 's also used in different business and education processes .
If we are talking about accommodation then accommodation in tents would be great - I love being close to nature .
I am not talking about some kind of achievements in those disciplines but they are my big passion
Unconnected part of all people 's lives is shopping .
As a teenager I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping .
It 's like , , walking in the clouds , , you feel like you are flying .
Choosing gives me such great pleasure because I never have to worry about where I get money for my wishes .
It 's hard for me even to imagine a situation when shopping is not enjoyable .
Probably it is one of the moments when you want something badly and you ca n't have it .
I hope your questions have been answered appropriately .
Instead of traditional telecommunications , we can talk by , e - mail or even see each other with the help of a computer network .
Among the large number of choices , this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view from the top of its towers , a charming story and one of the most representative examples of Catalonian modernist art .
We looked at every hotel in town , trying to give you the best offer .
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very casual clothes .
Finally , on the last day I suggest you go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around .
The aim of this report is to recommend you to visit the Fuerte de San Diego Museum .
I asked some people in town and this was the best place to choose .
The Fuerte de Sandiego Museum was built at the time when the Spanish people were trying to take all the lands from Mexico , one of the most important people who was at front of the Fuerte was Hernon Cortez , the first Spanish in have more lands than anyone at that time .
The Museum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco .
This invention has made our lives easier and quicker .
Service : It is over 100 years old but it is kept in good condition by the local people , who are proud of this castle .
It is a different experience .
History : At the castle there are always a few guides , who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle ( when it was built , by whom and why ) , which makes everyone enthusiastic .
I recommend visiting this castle , because it is interesting , marvellous and something different .
Nyremberg is also famous for this castle and the students will have a different experience and a lesson too .
Finally , there are a lot of museums in our town . Therefore , I would suggest going to the frogs museum , which is really fascinating .
subject : Aboriginal Art Museum .
The aim of this report is to describe the biggest building of our town .
b ) The building was built in 1999 . Therefore , it is an example of modern architecture .
In addition to this , we have chosen the luxury Palace Hotel , which is comfortable enough and in a good location .
Cars , boats , motorbikes , airplanes : Who has never used them once ?
In this world , where the nations fight to be the best one could n't be different , the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
The best way is definitely by air .
Thank you for your letter .
The bus will pick you up right at your hotel entrance .
You do not have to wear special clothes , just wear what you always wear .
On the top of the tower it has a huge clock on each side .
It was rebuilt in 1948 because of the Second World War , when it had been damaged .
The tower is absolutely marvellous .
I received your letter and I 'm happy to help you . We booked the Palace Hotel for your group . It 's nice and quiet .
When you go out of the hotel turn right and go straight on ; turn right again at the first crossroads .
In the big room where we 'll have the party , there 'll be some pictures of our college . You 'll see all the generations who passed through here .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube . The location of the conference is then five minutes by foot .
For the party I suggest you wear classic clothes ; maybe something black and not red or pink . I am going to wear classic black trousers and a white jersey - it might be that this information gives you some idea too .
I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown is n't well and hope he 'll get better soon . I am more than happy to give you the necessary information .
Regarding what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you take the students to our History Museum .
There is also a gift shop in there , where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends .
More and more people are learning how to drive and choosing to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time compared to travelling by public transport .
You do n't have to wait at a bus stop in cold and windy weather for a late bus , or be stuck on a train for an hour due to some track repairs . You can just jump into a car , tune your radio to your favourite station and have a pleasant drive to your destination .
I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutely love it !
I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music , as I brought some cassettes with me from Thailand .
I took a driving - theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a practical driving test very soon .
It is called the Palace Hotel , and we hope that it is going to meet your expectations .
I strongly recommend you to use public transport in order to get there , because you may find other types of transportation quite expensive .
Moreover , you must be aware of the fact that the conference is going to last two hours , until 10:00 pm .
After that our college has organised a barbecue night , with traditional local music that you must not miss .
I hope that you will find my information helpful .
THE HISTORICAL MUSEUM
Without any doubt , it is a historical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passing of the centuries .
Do n't miss the chance to visit the historical museum , located in the heart of the capital city .
The historical museum is simply a symbol , a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle : their freedom .
There are five different floors , each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history , starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967 .
Inside the museum there is a bookshop with a large variety of historical books , maps etc .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum ! ! !
When you are in the bus station you will catch bus number 37 , which will go to the town centre .
Anyway the college is the first road on your right from the town centre .
Architecture : It is a typical from this epoch with beautiful drawing on the wall and first kind of writing in the sports centre .
They decided to build more schools , especially in Switzerland because the people there were considered clever .
The people who will attend the party include many professors , semi - professors and faculties .
Firstly , there is the aquarium in the building .
I hope when you visit you will be favourite place .
Firstly , Palace Hotel has been booked for the group 's accommodation and I spoke with the hotel manager about travelling to the conference .
I am writing in reply to your letter about the international student conference .
And the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach , as there are about 35 international students , and they are all strangers here .
A big Buddha was built in 1997 just next to the temple , and it is the largest outdoor Buddha in the world .
It is easy to get there and free admission .
On the other hand , Hong Kong is known as a highly commercial city , and you could find something different in Po Lin Temple .
To hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe ; it 's wonderful and so real . You can imagine their face clearly .
I had a problem with my best friend once when we kept in touch through e - mail .
With reference to the information that you have requested , the hotel that has been booked is the Holiday Inn , in New Port and to get to the University of Wales , which is not far from the hotel , you only need to take a diversion where clearly indicate Carleon and once you are on the main road , all you need to do is to follow the country road which takes you directly to the place .
As for the last day , I would suggest you make a visit to the local museum and the ruins of the Castle .
In the first you will find a very interesting collection of Roman remains , also you can visit another section which is supposed to be a Roman site .
I always had considered myself to be very lucky to be born in the century because of all the amazing human inventions .
However , I feel that at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it 's very little , what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment .
I think that it will be nice for the end - of - conference party if you invite somebody to sing and give the students the time to enjoy themselves and to dance .
First of all we need the telephone in our house because it 's important to make a call if you need something or if something happens to your house and nobody is with you .
In the past people did n't have electricity and if they wanted , for example , to read or to cook something they used to light a fire .
You must have a TV because you can learn about what is happening in the world and you can see some places that you haven't been to .
I 'm very glad to be able to help you out with such a situation .
At the same time you are enjoying the castle you can take a break to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea . That is also amazing .
Yours sincerely ,
I am writing to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conference and other points in relation to it .
With the Internet you can communicate with people in different places of the world at the same moment .
I am writing to inform you that I have received a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college .
For those students who are very interested in shopping , clothes shops , jewellery , stationery , bookshops , fashion and beauty departments and many more are available .
For those who want something more exciting and adventurous , you are recommended to visit the Fun Fair and amusement arcade on the top floor of the building .
I am writing in connection with your letter about the international student conference .
You will never regret about my suggestion .
If you need more information let me know .
I 've received your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you are going to organise very soon . Here you have a little help for it .
First , I 'd like to tell you that the hotel where you are going to stay is " The Palace Hotel " , which is situated at the centre of the town .
It is a well - situated town with a lot of museums to visit , especially " the History Museum " , which I visited last year , and I think you will enjoy it .
It 's impossible nowadays to imagine a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business .
The answer was always the same : " Impossible " .
An old woman told me how important the phone was when her only son was abroad studying computers at " Chicago University " . She told me that every night she expected a call from her son , because her was the line of the happiness .
However , there was one person who told me he was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to write a lot , especially at Christmas when he wanted to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phones him , ending a very old tradition .
Firstly , about your accommodation , the college which I belong to offers visitors free accommodation with full of facilities
This party is unlikely to be that formal , but I recommend you do n't wear jeans and trainers .
I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it and maybe become familiar with our culture .
These days , we 're surrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented .
Let us try to appreciate their importance again .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definitely need one and that holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistics on your computer to do social research and some analyses .
My professor said , ' Go and get familiar with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail ' .
I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we usually use without thinking .
At the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel .
Lots of books , papers , lots of things on the tables .
Computers have helped to improve health because in this century we can use them in medical operations . Doctors can manage the most extreme operation easily and confidently .
No matter where you are , what you do , apparently , you need electricity .
For your last day I think it would be interesting to visit our historic and famous city centre .
People now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend their leisure time , to relax , or just to see something different than their home .
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is situated in the city centre , 15 minutes ' walk from where the conference takes place .
The group has been booked into a comfortable and well - situated hotel , whose name is the " Palace Hotel " .
Naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but something that is special is our cathedral .
Finally , I am sure you and your group will spend some enjoyable , relaxing days here .
It is well known in almost all families , often with a lot of different channels .
I can not imagine living without television , it is something that we need for our education , and for getting news and other helpful information .
Nowadays everyone has a telephone .
Nowadays we are very busy and we do n't have free time to see our friends , but we can call them and talk or chat with them .
The telephone is a very important invention if we can use it correctly without using it as a type of entertainment as many people do nowadays .
However , if you 're interested in archaeology you should visit the History Museum in Garden Square .
In the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using their car .
In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carrying our luggage and shopping bags .
For example , in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a horse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from .
On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allow us to get about quickly .
There are eye - max cinema , museums , a gallery .
Pusan Castle is located in the South of Pusan .
It was built four hundred years ago .
With reference to your letter which I received yesterday , I would like to give you some details about the international student conference , also the accommodation and activities that are planned during this week .
I hope this letter answers all your questions , if you want to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter .
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings which were built 10 years ago . They are some of the first buildings that were built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect .
In addition , the resort has an interesting historical background concerning the architecture and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico , for example , it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico .
In spite of the disadvantages , I would strongly recommend students and the public to visit the new Acapulco resort buildings and have a great experience learning about the buildings ' history and at the same time travelling around Mexico .
For the end - of - conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us with live music and catering .
Finally , to fill your free afternoon I would definitely recommend visiting the cathedral and having a walk around the old part of the city . If you want , it will be my pleasure to show you the area .
Chairs are not only part of the furniture , they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums where they are art objects .
The world is packed with so many types of chairs , from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a basic range of prices .
From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most useful gadget ever invented .
Some people use them in their work , others wish to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of movement .
I phoned the tourist information office last week and I got some information about the accommodation for the students .
As requested , the aim of this report is to assess the suitability for a group of American students of the visit to the Etruscan Museum .
It contains lots of archaeological Etruscans founded and some remains from the Estruscans ' necropolis .
Also there are some free headphones that explain the history of the museum .
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , I strongly recommend it for their excursion and because of their interests .
In my opinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line .
Basically , during three hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London .
Are you always happy when your telephone rings ?
Since I have been travelling around the world , I would have imagined being in touch with my family or friends without the Internet or my mobile phone .
This is an International student party , so I suggest you wear traditional costume .
You can inform all the students that they can take some traditional food to the party .
It includes a library ,
II suit , academic rooms , a GYM Club and a restaurant .
There is a very big library .
Just in the same building , you can find a restaurant .
They can also talk with British students to communicate study experience .
The group has been booked into the " Maria Luisa " Hotel , which is situated in the centre of Wimbledon called Wimbledon Village .
The purpose of this report is to give a brief description of the Academy of Art in St Petersburg .
This building is situated on the magnificent bank of the Niva River with an excellent view of the Hermitage Museum .
The building was built by a very famous Russian architect and is a marvellous example of Russian classic architecture of the XVIII century .
In the Academy of Art you can find the oldest art library , with a wide range of books , and the Museum of Russian Art , with a huge collection of paintings , sculpture and architectural projects from the early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries .
For example , I work for a bank , and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director living 800 kilometres away , and he does n't have to come here , we just have a phone conference where everybody can talk , and that is it !
Finally , on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now . It is up to you .
for Example , THAILAND , the United States of America , INDONESIA and CANADA .
Therefore I am thinking of selling my car , which has changed my life over the last 10 years , which has given me a kind of freedom , which has gone with me to all sorts of fantastic places , and changed my life for a new life : without a car .
Finally we enjoy a disco party so you should wear a suitable dress .
So he climbed on the ladder up to the window and he opened the door but policemen came there " what happened ? "
Jane explained that situation and they understood her .
I am writing to give you the information that you asked me for .
From there you can get a taxi , catch the number seven and eleven buses , which both take you very close to the conference centre , and also you can go by underground to get there .
Then , after the Conference , there will be a formal party at the group 's hotel , which starts at 9:00 pm and finishes at 12:00 midnight .
Yours sincerely
Hampton Court Palace is located in Hampton Court .
For the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel . Then we all set off to go on a sightseeing tour of Bromley town centre for about two hours before you leave for the airport .
Bromley town centre is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London .
We definitely need light to keep on . I dare say , without light , our life would go into a dark , dark hell .
I am writing to you to answer your question about the conference in London . Thank you for your letter .
I would like to inform you that the group you belong to has been booked into the Palace Hotel in the centre of London from the 24th of June until the 25th of June .
Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlemen a dark suit .
1 ) " Fontana di Trevi " sited in Trevis Square in the centre of Rome .
1 ) First of all , they are located in the centre of Rome so they can take a bus to get to them move and around the city .
Regarding your last question I can suggest visiting the Royal Castle .
Actually it is a whole complex , the Old and the New Castle , the cathedral and the very interesting underground part with its amazing crypts .
And if you climb to the top of the main tower - the keep - you will see unforgettable views of a white town .
You will find there an amazing collection of old weapons , armour and , we are especially proud of it , the great collection of swords .
After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurants located at the New Castle .
I am sure that should be enough for a one - day trip .
Please note that alcoholic drinks are only sold until 11 pm .
Coming back to ideas and Suggestions , I 've promised to give you a free afternoon before you catch your plane . I would advise you to visit our zoo or to go for a picnic in a park before you go to the party .
Such simple and everyday things like a telephone , a car , a computer only seem to be normal and everyday for us as we use them every day .
These inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared , but not everyone believes it is really so .
First of all they talk about the environmental pollution which cars and other vehicles create , overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some other problems .
I think the telephone is the most important thing in many people 's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it does n't matter where you are ( I am talking about mobile phones , which a majority now have through choice ) .
I think it would n't be possible for us to survive without electric light .
Because of shipbuilding developments people were able to make all those geographical discoveries , and automobile transport is an undeniable necessity in our life .
Because of everything I have said I am more likely to think that the benefits of people 's inventions are much greater than all their disadvantages .
If you have any further questions , please do not hesitate to contact me .
SUBJECT : Recommendations for a place to visit
The place I would like to recommend is the seventeenth - century Royal Palace .
The Old Town is the best place for an afternoon stroll , with a great deal of restaurants , cafes and street performers .
There are a number of hotels or youth hostels to stay overnight , if necessary .
I am pleased to provide the information you need for the group .
The hotel I booked is the Palace Hotel which is in the centre of London just two blocks from Victoria station .
I think it is very convenient for the group . You know the Victoria area , it is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city . About the hotel , it is clean , and provides a good service . The rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value . And the best way to get to the College for the conference is to walk to Victoria station , get the tram to Glouster Road and after 3 blocks on the left - hand side you will find the College .
However I am going to make a plan for each student with all of the details and the address .
About the party at the end of conference , we are organising it in the same hotel which has a nice salon .
It will be good for your group because you do n't need to move to another place .
It is not a formal party so I think it is fine to wear something not too formal .
I want to suggestions for the last day . You and your group could maybe go to Green Park and visit the Queen 's house and Parliament , this area is very nice and the group would engoin after the conference to get some fresh air . Another option could be the new Tell Gallery . I have never been there but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you .
I have been hearing about the Ave they have in the exhibition , it is interesting .
I hope you found this letter useful and if you have any questions , let me know .
I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
Yours sincerely
The computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started processing information with a big card which was perforated and made a small hole and each hole meant something like a code .
The machine that was used for reading this card was very big , you used to need a room for the computer .
I remember when I had the first lesson at the University and the teacher took us to the Computer Centre and I saw these machines , all my colleagues and I were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with this kind of computer .
These days the computer is part of your life , you use it all the time . Sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank , use transport , go shopping etc . It is a machine that makes life easy and ibendow you can carry it everywhere . It is amazing the way as the fas the computer changes , the programs are faster and more useful and practical .
But the computer has a bad side too . I whand mean we life each day we depend more and more on it .
So I feel scared when I think about the consequences if some of the viruses or mad people misuse as happens these days with sex or other .
I work with children and the computer helps me in my job but affects it too .
So I hope the world reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent these problems because something good could be something very dangerous .
Both of them are as convenient as getting there .
End of all , in my opinion we could go to the centre of the town because there are many places to have a look at and go shopping .
So that 's why they have invented the telephone .
Take the bus in the direction of the centre of town .
With the computer , we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again . We save the letter and in three weeks we could send it to another person .
If we had n't any , we would have to write all the transactions on paper .
I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accommodation of the group and it will be quite easy to get everywhere on foot from the hotel during your stay .
There is no need to bother about clothes .
Before you leave England , I suggest you visit the canals and small villages around Basingstoke . You could have the opportunity to see the country life .
Would n't it be unbearable and painful ?
Certainly it would be just like mine .
Because I live in a rural area , far from any village , town , or city centre .
But also I 'm aware that time flies for me . I must do whatever I want before it is too late .
And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most useful invention for humanity .
As you need more information , I will answer all your questions with pleasure .
It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college , so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot .
Finally , you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historic places ( castles built in the 13th century ) or art galleries , as well as the beautiful Bodnant Garden .
I think that one of the most important inventions affecting our life is the telephone .
I have just received the letter from you and I 'm writing to you as soon as possible .
The best way to get from there to the conference is by coach , which I have arranged for you .
Then we can have a rest in the cafe and talk before your flight home .
I think I have given you all the important information .
Nowadays motorization is one of the most important inventions .
When you look around everybody has a car or motorcycle .
No matter that people started worried more about pollution in the world .
I love motorcycles and I do n't think I could live without them .
I have ridden a motorcycle since I was 16 years old .
We rode motorcycles for a few days before we finally got to our meeting points .
I really enjoy riding my motorcycle .
When I ride it is only me and my motorcycle .
I am really grateful to the people who invented the first motorcycle in the world .
To sum up , I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers , which has affected both individuals and society as a whole .
Personally I recommend the Dickens tour because it is a good length walk and very historical .
The bus leaves at 8 a.m. from the front entrance of the hotel .
The end - of - conference party is in a tent and in the grounds .
It will be a surprise !
On the last afternoon you could go on a city tour , visit the Museum of Fine Arts , or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the public park .
The museum is near the city centre and is accessible by bus or walking .
It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building , approximately one mile away .
The increasing number of cars related and infrastructure is now creating problems .
A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded , and environmental problems are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries .
People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting their mobility .
If you are free I will show you around our college .
The countless fascinating things will definitely take you the whole day to appreciate .
I love baking cakes , cookies and breads .
However , there is something about which it is still believed that it was an extremely important invention .
In my opinion , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most machines , appliances and equipment which are used in modern times can only be operated with electricity , which makes people not do too much physical labour .
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith ,
I hope that our friend Richard Brown does n't have any serious illnesses .
This party is for the students so the clothes wo n't be so formal .
We can choose between two options for spending our free time .
I do n't like thinking of my house or my life without all these facilities .
Now , you just need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city , with a car , aeroplanes , shops , all these things without lights .
It is supposed to be from 7 pm to 11 pm .
I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some questions , please do not hesitate to contact us .
Lots of great inventions have been invented in order to help people live comfortably .
Because there are a lot of beautiful trees and you can see the sea .
By the way , the end - of - conference party is a kind of farewell party .
The first part , the chairman and a few guests will give a speech and the second part , the participants will evaluate themselves , and the last part will consist of dinner and drinks .
For example : electricity , the computer , telephone , boat , and car ( wheel ) , etc .
It has absolutely reduced women 's housework time .
She appears occasionally and opens every window in the castle .
I would suggest they wear formal clothing , such as tie , trousers and blazer .
The building is called the Chiang Kei - shek Memorial Hall .
The Memorial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds .
As you go into the main Hall , you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei - shek . This is because the building is the remembrance of how well Chiang did in History .
Apart from the main Hall , there are also lots of other galleries .
In these galleries there are Historical paintings and antique furniture which Chiang used .
there are also restaurants and modern galleries .
When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical things , you might as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
Finally , if you want to visit this building I would recommend you stay at a hotel not far from the memorial Hall called the Hyatt Hotel .
OLYMPIC MUSEUM
The Olympic Museum is situated near the lake and offers , for the tourist , an unbelievable view of the mountains and the lake .
I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holiday in Yverdon .
It is a modern hotel , near our college , and it is also very convenient for the airport . You can take either bus or taxies .
The number 101 bus leaves from the airport , then you can get off at the " city college " stop .
Nowadays people have become used to watching television programmes every day .
Someone is talking , laughing , crying on there , so join them . You will feel much better than you would just by yourself .
Some TV programmes are enjoyable !
In conclusion , TV has both advantages and disadvantages , but on the whole the advantages are greater than the disadvantages .
On the positive side , you and the group will be able to learn more about Welsh artworks which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furniture .
And some old toilets might look awful .
So , I 'm writing to reply to give all the information you asked for .
The best way to get from the hotel to the conference is using the tube because it takes only 20 minutes .
And your speech would be better for the end of conference party .
Some people might say electricity is more important than any other thing .
For instance , when I want to contact my friend , it 's quite helpful to use e - mail .
However , the computer is worth using in our life until a more convenient machine is invented .
It also holds an international exhibition all year round .
In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she was a little girl there was only one telephone in the building where she lived .
It was in her parents ' apartment .
It is not an easy decision how to react now .
thank you for your letter , which arrived yesterday .
I hope to give you all the information you need and , please , if you want more information or something is not clear , please do n't hesitate to contact me again .
It 's a very comfortable hotel where you can find everything you need .
From there to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus , which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town centre .
For this conference I suggest wearing something very comfortable but elegant . The organisation wants all the men to wear a jacket , but a tie is not necessary .
If I find something special you will be able to visit in three hours I will call you .
It is the most important church in this area because of its architecture .
It is something very special . Its ceiling is made from many small pieces of wood . Its windows with many colours . It is fantastic .
I look forward to hearing from you
I hope that all the information you need will be provided satisfactorily .
Secondly the best way to go from the hotel to the conference centre is to use one of the shuttle buses we provide at this event .
Finally , concerning your free afternoon , there are plenty of activities , but I suggest you visit the Caldea centre , which is a very special bath centre .
If you need further information do not hesitate to contact us .
There are plenty of churches , cathedrals , and old cottages .
The churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of their different Romanic styles .
Finally if none of my suggestions fit with your expectations , let me know more about what kind of buildings you are interested in and I 'll do my best to find something more suitable .
To finish , if you have spare time , you could walk in the centre of Poitiers which is very beautiful .
In the Pompidou centre , there are different exhibitions on different themes .
So if you visit Paris , the Pompidou centre is a very interesting building to visit , even if in Paris there are many other buildings .
It is situated in the centre of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college , where the conference is going to be held .
I think that the best choice for you is to take the 234 bus .
Also there is a very good shopping centre next to the museum .
To conclude I would like to say that the governments of all developed countries would n't have been so concerned about the so - called " problem 2000 " if the computer had not been so important for modern society .
First , I would like to congratulate you on your new responsibility , because of Mr Brown 's illness .
There , I saw the exhibitions and admired the building itself .
If you go down a few steps , you will discover the cellar .
She is looking for an interesting job , and applying to many companies .

This is what you should do . ``
Each of these statements either invalidates or attempts to explain upset feelings or offers a solution designed suddenly to change her negative feelings to positive feelings .

The cerebral wave activity is classified into groups , each one named with a Greek letter : Alpha , Delta , Gamma and Theta .
So , Alpha waves have a frequency of 0 . 5 and 0 . 4 cycles per second , and they are often found in a state of deep sleep .
Theta waves have a frequency of 5 and 7 cycles per second , and they are found in the state between wakefulness and dreaming .
Alpha waves have a frequency between 8 and 14 cycles per second , and they are found in states of peace and a relaxed alert .
Beta waves have a frequency of 15 and 22 cycles per second , and they are found in a state of crisis , anxiety and aggressiveness .

He called strangers secretly with a nervous and expectant voice , `` hello , you do n't know me , but , can we have a chat ? `` . Especially when that tramp told 1900 his experience .

How do movies or TV affect people ? No . 4
Heroes and heroines achieve great success of their business , attain sweet love of their life , and gain high respect of their fame so easily within a two - hour long movie .
When watching it , audiences can experience the same events and share the same feelings . As a result , this whole process would fulfill their fantasies and cause them to find balance in their lives , or to some degree , lose the balance in their lives . This all depends not only on the movies but also the audiences themselves .
To put it differently , tasks are arduous for mass media to bring people laughter , joy and relaxation , and at the same time some pedagogic meanings .

Hello , my friends . First of all , I want to apologize to all my friends at lang - 8 for being absent for this long period due to the requirements in my last year of college . No doubt that I miss you all . I pick up this topic because everybody here is talking about the referendum in sudan these days . To the people who do n't know much about Sudan , it is the biggest country in Africa and located on east side of Africa ; south of Egypt . My country has struggled with political instability and prolonged wars since being liberated from the British 50 years ago . Unfortunately Sudan was born with wars and the most harmful one was in South Sudan . That war is considered the longest war in the history of Africa or modern history . The war continued 50 years after liberation , killed two million Sudanese citizens , and caused four million Sudanese citizens to emigrate due to the paralyzed economy we had during this ugly war .
Sudan is a country of different races , languages , and religions , but specific parts in the north are more educated than other parts of Sudan . This is because during British rule the south and west of Sudan were closed areas and the government did n't allow any cultural developmental . So , soon after liberation the Sudanese found themselves with big challenge of how to rule this wide country where the north Sudanese were more educated . The government was ruled by them and other citizens felt like this government does n't represent them . The biggest historical mistake is that this government did not change British policy of closed lands . As result of this huge mistake , the racism grew between Sudanese populations and rapidly the southern Sudanese took up arms to get their rights in Sudan . At that point , no Sudanese , including southern Sudanese , had the idea for a separation . They just wanted their rights in their country as whole Sudan . And , as days go by , and wars burned houses and killed children and women , the idea of separation from Sudan arose . In 2005 , the happiest year of Sudanese history , the government and ( splm ) stopped the war in South Sudan the Nifasha Peace Agreement has born . The government promised a lot political changes : the system became democratic and a successful election also occurred . Southern Sudanese can rule their own lands by the new federal system . In the Nifasha Peace Agreement , the government sponsored the referendum right after six years of the treaty . This period was supposed to be the rehabilitation period of the wars affect on the south . The south took more than 50 percent of the oil to rehabilitate southern Sudan by SPLA . Due to the bad situation in the south and huge corruption , not many changes took place in health and education and most of the money was spent on south Sudanese army . Due to the environment which lacks any trust , now the 6 years is running out fast and the Sudanese face a referendum one month from now . The news is not good about the south , because a lot of politicians see the separation as the start of a new phase of war in Sudan because most of the oil in Sudan lies in the boundaries between south and north . And these boundaries have not been defined yet , so the Sudanese are worried about witnessing another endless war . The situation is very tense and everybody is expecting the worst , but there is hope that the referendum will lead to unity . And if that occurs , it will be the true liberation of Sudan and a promising future . We pray for our children to be raised in a united Sudan without bloodshed .

Another subtle explanation rests on the fact that country inhabitants are fortunate enough to enjoy the cozy and pleasant ambiance of the family without exhausting their social life .
On the contrary , it would be far more difficult to acquire such pleasure for those urbanites .
Naturally , it is possibly too reckless to assert that nothing beneficial comes from city life since several accompanying merits also come along with it .

I was driving a car near my house which is in a residential area .
Then behind me , another car tried to pass my car several times .
He was probably in a hurry , but of course passing is prohibited in the area because of the nearby school .
But I was a Japanese business man as well .
Chloe desperately asked father , but he kept laughing for around 10 minutes .
We are going somewhere for the first time .
On the other hand , when we return from somewhere , we tend to feel it 's not so far away compared with the first time .

I found that we Chinese students could n't understand our European teacher very well .
Our social environment has influenced us so much .
I prepared for this test a long time , but still lack confidence .
So , I guess the test is like a door in my way , if I do n't pass it , nothing will change or happen .
I think I can do it , I believe I can do it , but success is not only composed by just believing .
Some people have gotten married already ; others have bought their own house or car .
We are living a different life style .
But the good thing is that I will see all of my relatives which I normally do n't get to see .
For people in Touhoku , which is located in northern Japan , the situation is much more serious .
I like sushi , which is a Japanese traditional dish .
It is delicious and interesting because you can choose various types of sushi which you like .
Except the learning aspect of the internet , I ca n't forget about funnier ones , such as Manga , Anime , drama , films , books , songs , and a lot more . These things not only help me learn the language in certain situations , but it also gives me a lot of pleasure , SO THANK YOU INTERNET xD
That is why I write [ in my ] diary when I experienced interesting things or have questions .
I think I have to get to bed right away ~
I learned Hangul today by myself .
It was very easy lol I learned most of them in a day .
This airport was equiped with WI - FI and I had a new smartphone .

Some really want to change their aggressive personality or bad attitude .
There are exceptions , of course , but those are few .
Recently anime costume parades are very popular especially among geeks and foreign people ; P
Several years ago , on Halloween day , many foreign people with costumes got together on the Osaka loop line and stayed there many hours !
It was so fun ! ! but it became a problem and was banned for next year : (
There were many Thai food stalls and , someone who was from Thailand was singing her country 's song .
I ate kaomangai ( rice with boiled chickin ) , tomyamkun ( spicy red seafood soup ) , and pattai ( noodles without soup ) .
I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the center of the city which is surrounded by a park .
There is a commercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kinds of businesses : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , grocers , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .
Consequently , I realized that although cycling outside helped me to improve my fitness , really I enjoyed most breathing fresh air and taking pleasure in the countryside .
The best place for young people in our area is without doubt the lake .
Luckily , the schools are closed for ten weeks , so the young girls and boys have a lot of time to spend their
Leaving my country , Somalia , was very hard for me .
But when I was there , I began to make new friends that I never thought I would have , and I never imagined the way that I was going to know them either . At the beginning , I felt very strange talking with them , but now we are very good friends .
We went to to Acapulco to play , to an event where universities from Mexico go and present cultural activities .
Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there . That was an incredible experience that I will never forget .
Using public transport can be difficult , because we have a strict time and , normally , we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely uncomfortable .
One argument for not using the car is that petrol is very expensive , but public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantage is not so good , actually .
The story took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by doctors and scientists .
But we should n't forget the pollution cause by cars . We should use a bicycle or public transportation more .
If we are working with someone in the same job who lives near us or is our neighbour , we can go to work in the same car . This way we use less petrol .
The governments are also important for taking care of the environment .
In total , there were 32 people , a white kitten and a dog .
That night , the dog , the kitten , Tom and Michel slept in the same room , and that was n't too bad .
When Michael got up in the morning , he realized that his kittten had disappeared , and he found Tom 's dog with some white hair in his mouth .
He thought that the dog had eaten the kitten during the night , so he shouted at Tom , opened the door and went away .
For those people who want to start to do the street workout , I advise you to start with basic exercises such as pull ups , push ups , dips and squats .

Edison and his research team made his discovery commercially and create a company called " Edison Electric Light Company " .
In my bedroom there is a brown bed , a yellow chest of drawers , a little light brown bedside table and a big brown wardrobe .
The environment is our surroundings . There is no awareness in our locality . They are busy with their own work . No one focuses on or sees what is happening in our town . They usually speak about how hot it is today , but they do n't know what makes it this hot . I am interested in planting trees and making our surroundings clean . Some people used to burn the forest as if the forest is useless . Man is greedy because all the things we get from the forests are free .
Management accounting practice is very important for an organization for making decisions about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers .
To take care of the environment , each of us has to do something such as propaganda to the people in the country . About my village , we use banana leaves instead of nylon , dispose of garbage sensibly ... and so on .
Are you studying mathematics for your exam ?
I 'm a happy , energetic person who likes to work with children .
In my country people make a lot of mistakes and have a lot of bad habits concerning their attitude towards rubbish . They are always throwing their old things and rubbish away in public places . The government also can not do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour .
The thing that he ( the monster ) did n't know about was that he had a spectacular infection ( literally spectacular ) that I think had no cure . It was called " The Monsteration Infections " .
Scientists were trying to find a cure for the Monsteration Infections , but they still do n't have it .
I have needed to use English a lot of times during my professional activities . For that reason I took some English lessons many years ago .
I can tell you that I feel I can understand over 90% when I 'm listening and when I 'm reading , but my main problem with English is , of course , when I have to speak . I fee terrible and without confidence . I think that I 'm always thinking in Spanish and then doing the translation into English . Maybe at this moment , while I 'm writing this composition , I 'm making the same mistake . I know that learning English is a long process , but I must follow that process because I 'd like to be an excellent bilingual person .
Currently , I 'm working as a teacher at the university and teaching in English is my goal .
I also work as a freelance worker with the same subjects because it is necessary to increase my income .
I 'm writing now without using a dictionary and doing this composition without translating from Spanish ( I hope hahaha )
I hope you can help me understand more about how to improve my English level and develop my skills .
Thank you for your attention , and I 'll wait for your advice , ( this is my first time writing over 50 words )
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions . This mostly happens in high class families , as they focus on achievements like power , political influence etc . On the other hand , for middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as they are inherited from our ancestors in terms of values like honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .
Public transport has no future . The crisis in 2008 has reduced oil prices , The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the government give incentives for consumers .
I know that I have not written it but I have a brother .
I like to speak English at school too , but my friends do n't like it when I speak it in school , so I speak Swedish there .
My favourite lessons are the Swedish lessons because I like to write stories .
My family lives in a

This year is my sixteenth birthday and I 'm going to celebrate at home , with my family and some friends .
This summer was the best . I went to Cuchilla Alta with my best friends . Their names are : Emilia , Agustina , Micaela and Lucía .
I like English because it is very important to know other languages to communicate with other people and if I go to another country it is very important to know English .
We got to work at four in the afternoon and it was very relaxing . I had a day off when I spent time at home or going to the gym , where I met handsome guys .
You see , man , I do n't like crowded roads , a nd prefer to travel by tram .
The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pulished , but the construction of seaports and airports must with congenital condition .
I rather enjoy spinning , feeling the rhythm of the music louder and louder . This gives me high energy each time I go spinning .
To conclude , in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there is no doubt that the public transport system would be less inconvenient than travelling by car .
First , the bank notes are considered how to design , including background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then , they are prepared by skilled machinists .
If the sheets are good , those sheets are then cut into separate bank notes and packed into cars in order to be dispatched all over the city .
I believe that using your car has a lot of advantages or benefits . It is more comfortable and less expensive .
Yoga calms and vitalizes body and mind .
And government , please do n't be so flabby with your own citizen .
For beginners in this sport I would recommend that a trainer teaches swimming properly because it is very important to pay attention to the position of the arms .
May Maybe they are comfortable , terrible , , dangerous or average .
Cars and buses become dangerous and cause problems in the street .
She turned her head and saw him . " He was following me " , she thought . " Well , I should ask him what he is doing here " .
First of all , finishing high school is a rite of passage that indicates the beginning of a new chapter for students .
When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you gain a lot of knowledge , culture , discoveries and , with all of this , you gain personal experience .
The job provides , like the trip , responsibility and experience .
The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career prejudicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are too old to study at a university .
Besides that , they have different points of view on many subjects , that is why they may not like the fun and the conversation in the social life with other students .
They can not enjoy this chapter with young and fresh thoughts .
It is a big decision , that brings great consequences and great experiences .
As an example , if a student needs to recuperate a subject or has to get a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time .
They would consider you as an independent person .
Accordingly , you would take responsibility for what you did .
I am overwhelmed with grief , living with them .
Eating habits in my country have really changed in the last ten years .
it 's r is n't clear completely , but I suppose it depends on changing life habits in the development process of our society .
But a good change in our habits is the attention to calories and healthy food , because of getting information on the internet and other media that are easily accessible for all people these days .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he had forgotten what he had to do . After thinking , he remembered that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her in his car as the doctor 's clinic was far away from her house . Peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother 's house in the next street . After he arrived , he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the street . He apologized to her and asked her to get into the car . " Never mind " she said and got in the car beside him .
However , travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . Travelling by bus is not as convenient as getting in a car , but you can never know what might happen with your car , where it might get stuck in traffic or some other accident might happen .
Travel plans need to depend on public transport timetables .
Besides , Hong Kong also has many country parks for hiking .
Tom is studying in London .
Although Canada is an English - speaking country , in Montreal , the official language is French .
So I do not have the opportunity to practise English , because most of my colleagues speak French .
I was inspired by a true legend . His name is Edan Hazard .
That fact behind sense because the maintenance of public transport is not the responsibility of the traveler .
If we want to count function of public transport because it 's not enough words to say . But public transport is a much needed service in big cities as well as small villages .
I 'm sure you 'll agree that Red Square is the most popular sight in the capital of Russia .
I remember two contrasting moments . One day , we had to create a team to do an exercise which used the brain ; they chose me .
The reasons for stress are more diverse ; perhaps because we have an exam period , family problems or because we think in a negative way , or we have destroyed ourselves through long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfort , and lots of reasons to stress ...
We must get rid of the stress quickly before we lose ourselves , because it 's very harmful . For example , you can read a book , do sport , play music , eat delicious food , remember all the positive things that have happened to you , talk with someone who you trust , get rid of everything that makes you upset and makes your life tiring , go out and eat a meal with your best friends , and there are a lot of things you can do ...
Remember that stress is not a lasting thing , and you can avoid it .
In other words , both bad sheets and the ones which are separated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from getting into the market .
Many people believe that nowadays there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient , but others continue with the thought that they do help , for example , with travelling long distances .
The ticket does n't cost too much and it is affordable for the majority of people , at least compared to buying a car .
Secondly , public transport is more efficient for travelling long distance than cars and people would n't have to purchase fuel .
When people need to travel to other continents or far away , they may need a plane , which is a form of public transport , to complete the journey because they have to cross oceans and complicated distances that have different landforms .
However , a car is something which belongs to the person and he can do whatever he wants and find it in the same state he left it in , and sometimes public transport vehicles are n't left in the best way .
In addition , you have to share with people you absolutely do n't know and probably wo n't see again .
But , by observing all these people , you can enrich yourself with the different cultures and manners the others have and incorporate new topics .
That was my first time on holiday in another country that was n't northern Italy .
We visited a lot of monuments , museums and churches , like the Louvre with the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci .
It depends on five main steps , which include design , preparation of metal plates , printing , inspection , packaging and destruction or disposal depending on whether the fourth step is good or bad .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinists .
If it 's good , they go to packing and distribution , whereas the others should be destroyed as well .
In conclusion , the whole process is an unreversed schedule .
It cosumemed the power which includes humans and machines .
To begin with is design , we have to consider background colour , artwork , and security issues , and then we are supposed to prepare metal plates , using skilled machinists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheets of bank notes , are printed ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) . There are some requirements -- colour on both sides , special ink , slightly raised images .
Finally , if it is a good sheet , the procedure is packaging and distribution , including cutting into separate bank notes , packing , dispatching .
If it is a bad sheet , the procedure is disposal -- bad sheets and bank notes should be securely destroyed .
And then he realised it was an enormous lion .
But suddenly he heard a noise , it was his mum . " Max where are you ? " she screamed . The lion disappeared in one second , running .
Max spent the rest of the day thinking about that lion until he went into his room . " What an amazing day ! " ,

As part of my plan to improve my English skills , I decided to search on the internet for any free program which could help me with the plan to improve my English writing .
Trieste is a little town situated in the north - east of Italy .
So the environmental impact is very attractive .
Another problem is that the citizens of Trieste do n't pay attention to the environmental problems of their city .
I think it is important that , not only in the family , but also in school , we could raise a new generation sensitive to the ecological problems of the earth .
I usually go two days a week but next month I am going to go three or four days a week because I hope to enter a local competition .
It turned out that that young boy had a good head for fishing and now they always go fishing together .
I like running , riding my bike , playing football , skiing in winter , climbing , etc .
I like football because it is a sport that I have played since I was small and I think that it is the most fun and exciting team sport .
The amount of garbage is increasing at the same time as the number of humans is increasing .
The growth of consumption in developing countries leads to increasing consumption of energy , water and other resources .
Nowadays , our local government is making some decisions to improve the situation .
There are a lot of citizens movement except official activities .
People organise common action for cleaning areas near houses .
These activities take place especially in spring and in autumn .
Everyone is curious about making bank notes .
The bank notes are designed carefully . Workers need to design their background colour and artwork .
Then , the notes will be prepared on metal plates . After that , printing . The notes will be printed in colour on both sides with special ink and they will have slightly raised images .
Good ones will be packaged and distributed . workers will cut them and deal with them carefully .
The rest of them will be disposed of .
I think that Cádiz is the perfect place to meet , because Cádiz has coast , sea , and mountains .
In Cádiz , in summer , there are a lot of opportunities to work .

These people can influence our lives . For example , if you have bad friends you become a bad person and you will have problems in your life . So , your education depends on the people around you .
In general , people have the possibility to study in libraries or using computers .
Personally , I think studying on a computer is a better choice .
We need to do something to save the world !
I think they are our first friends and our first confidants .
Think about a family 's routine .
The Brazil and Netherlands games were a real test of our health .
And I think that it 's not technology that will change , but the people and their characters .
Unfortunately , for this generation , there wo n't be real relationships , all relationships will become virtual relationships .
According to my experience , if we do n't exaggerate the way we use technology like the internet , phone , satellite .
For example , now high - heeled shoes are very trendy but they cost a lot and most women do n't look good in them .
Transportation is one of the most essential parts of our day to day life ; whether it is public or private , transport takes the same priority in each person 's life from the very early days .
In the age before industrialisation came into existence , people also used various alternatives to travel from one place to another .
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convenient .
Continuing my visit to London , I will visit the largest park in London , Hyde Park , which has a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for the preservation of the park .
follow in London I 'll go for a walk to get to Big Ben , which is the most beautiful building in all its splendour , where I will take pictures .
Later , I 'll take the London Underground , which is a public fast transit system . I 'll travel on it .
My favorite band is " cbjr " ; it 's a Brazilian band . The type of music is rock and rap . Their music is very easy to single .

To sum up , I think it is inevitable .
He loved Rose with his entire soul , a soul that he was losing .
Suddenly , he took the agreement and signed the piece of paper with his blood .
Do you know a new recipe for cooking chicken ?
Our town takes care of the environment of our neighbourhood very seriously .
Not only the supermarket has these containers . They are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion , this gives a good example of the involvement of the local government .
The majority of people visiting Katowice are focused on three things : souvenirs , fashion and food .
Fortunately , visitors will find all of that in the Tourist Information Office and in shops on the outskirts .
So , he is hard - working . He is a lawyer and always helps me with all my professional problems .
However , a few years ago , the government has paid more attention to the environment of our country . For example , they did a lot of advertising on television , in newspapers and on the internet to explain that rubbish is not good for our world .
In the castle there is the Holy Trinity Chapel .
The famous dish of this restaurant is a huge hamburger .
So , train is an intermidiate way to travel .
I am writing to apply for the job in the USA published in an advertisement last Monday .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities , private cars are more attractive for most people .
Some people say that a trip by car is more convenient than by public transport , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
But public transport has a future for a lot of reasons . First , time . If the place you want to reach is really far , the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car . Also , the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe , there is no highway that crosses the ocean . You need an airplane and , unless you have one , you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car . A different reason is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska , you will not need to pass through Canada . Comfort is a really important reason , because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe . Economics is a factor too , because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do . It will be more expensive than on public transport .
In conclusion , for me , it is a lie that public transport has no future . However , they have to make improvements to this , like the use of better types of fuel or energy . One way is using renewable sources of energy , such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hydraulic(water),Also , there are biodiesel and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
Dear Anne , Thank for your letter asking about my family and my friends .
When somebody gets home , he wants only to relax in front of the television .
Besides this , TV companies have understood sports provide this relaxing moment , mainly for men .
In this view , I think that though there are lots of sports on television , there are not too many , because people have looke for it .
When the day came , we performed an amazing choreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals .
This American band is known for their lyrics that something different from other bands , something close to an emotional statement .
My teacher said that public transport has no future in our society , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . Nevertheless , I disagree with her opinion because if we use public transport we will pollute less .
Without travelling , people would be very bored , life would be very monotonous .
Nowadays people use cars a lot .
In the past , it was n't like that . People did not have cars . They just relied on public transport .
There are a few people who use public transport , like students and people who have a low income . In my view , I can say the public transport might be going to e close because nobody is going to beclose
He has been done several laws again Spanish citizens .
I have been playing this sport since twelve years ago . This sport has taught me to respect others and not to assault them.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is that I do n't want to be weak . I would n't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule : the strong dominate the weak . When I step foot in the gym , I forget everything : school , home ... . Therefore , I enjoy it .
Humans are looking for power and they apply the law of the jungle , the strongest beat the weakest .
What are the criteria of this ranking ? and ...
Chemical drugs can help people to heal and recover from diseases , but they have another hidden effect .
Therefore , The aforementioned information above shows that our future could be worse than our present .
We should live in a stable and peaceful world .
Nowadays , people use their cars to travel for work , for holidays ...... but if the petrol were cheaper , they could travel a lot .
After the preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists , they take sheets of bank notes . There are three requirements for this : colour on both sides , special ink and images that are slightly raised .
It smelled terrific , and tasted so good .
It was pancakes and egg with bacon .
After that I played with my brothers out in the garden .
They usually do n't want to be with me , but today we played all day long .
It was such fun and I could n't stop smiling .
He told us that he was really embarrassed about what had happened and he apologised for his attitude .
It will not be trendy because everybody will have his own car .
There are advantages and disadvantages ; television can also cause a dependence , cartoons and " stupid " programs can harm young people most .
Today , there are many children that have a dependence on television , they prefer to stay at home to watch the various children 's TV programs , while once our parents preferred hanging out with their friends .
Television can be a useful instrument if it is used with caution . Therefore , I recommend using it less to prevent damage to the mind .
In order to help reduce pollution , I take action using the three " Rs " : reduce , reuse and recycle , so I am more and more eco - friendly .
I reduce the use of unnecesary power at home . In other words , I turn on a light that I need while I use it ; I take cooler showers ; I heat only the necessary rooms .
In order to reuse , I convert all things reusable , for example , a plastic bottle as a plant pot ; a glass bottle as a food container . I take my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a plastic shopping bag if a salesman offers me one .
A car is less expensive , more comfortable , faster and safer .
For example , travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plane is faster .
On the other hand , it helps to reduce the pollution made by cars , ..
The picture illustrate the process of making notes .
Then , preparation of the metal plates and skilled machinists are needed .
If the printed sheets are good quality , they will be packed and distributed . Some partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate or packed or dispatched . The bad sheets will be disposed on . The destruction will be secure .
So it is not always a good thing , unless they are open - minded or have their own methods to punish you in a gentle way that wo n't make you regret telling them your faults or mistakes .
I felt that I could lose consciousness . That 's why I removed the bracelet .
I am glad to hear from you .
I am 24 years old . I am from Lviv Ukraine .
My hobbies are football and gym .
I am studying environmental science .
Now , to answer your question , I have many favourite places near my town because I live in a lovely little town , but there is one place that is special to me : ' A Fervenza do Pedregal ' . '
It is a very quiet place . Because of its location , in the middle of the forest , only a few people know how to get there .
It is an incredible forest , the ground is covered in low grass and there is a little river where you can swim . It is the perfect place to have a quiet day .
That is all I can tell you about this place . I hope that my answer will help you with your project .
What is your last name ?
I say to people that want to try this sport that it ' s easy if you love it .
If you try this sport in the wrong way you could have health problems . For example , you could have problems with your hands , in your neck and in your legs .
Emily knew she would have to come to a decision soon .
The problem for Emily was that her boyfriend was as cold as the weather .
She thought he was so boring , but she did n't want to be alone . she did n't know how to live on her own and Emily was utterly terrified of being alone .
The purpose of this report is to make people more aware of the importance of taking care of the environment in order to eradicate this problem which has serious consequences nowadays .
The council is carrying out a project in order to eradicate rubbish from my town .
Combating the destruction of the environment , this is a serious problem throughout the world .
Nowadays , many trees and grassland areas are damaged in many countries , lots of building are constructed .
And people should pay attention to this problem and try to solve it .
For instance , people need too many places to build the modern society , so they cut down lots of trees , burning many grassland areas .
Another factor is that the animals do not control themselves and eat the plants leading to the destruction of the ecosystem .
Although this change makes the life of people efficient , the problem should not be ignored .
It would really be helpful if the government made tighter restrictions . In today 's world , there are lots of construction companies and factories are not admission , they are destroying the forest , farmland and wetland , discharging waste water and emitting greenhouse gas . It leads to a serious environmental problem .
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work , as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expenses we encounter .
The other benefit of taking public transport is fewer people are taking cars , reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environment .
Karate is one of the best sports I have ever enjoyed in my life . One of the reasons behind my passion for karate is that it 's a means of taming the mind and the body .
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teases me , and to be alert as well . Also , it helps me to always look slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well . People who want to start doing karate have to be patient .
They should immerse themselves in daily exercise as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active . for instance , it 's advised to eat large amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly .
My favorite sports are football , basketball , Formula One and Tennis .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which means bullet train , is famous and very fast .
" Blue train " , which has many beds on the train and we can sleep comfortably on the train .
Second , travelling by train is safe and reasonable compared to planes .
Travelling by train is cheep and getting a ticket is easy for us in our country .
And terrorism is scarce also .
A plane which was travelling from Egypt to Russia was exploded by terrorists last month .
What did you do yesterday ?
I 'm nineteen years old and from this city but living in a dormitory at Ton Duc Thang university .
When I am running , all the pressure I felt is gone .
We have Earth first , then people , than our house .
Earth is our home , we all have to protect it .
But now people are destroying it .
Just for money for more houses , but if we destroy it , we will all die . Our money will be gone , our house will be gone , we will have nothing .
Besides , some people destroy farmland to build houses , but if one day there is no farmland , then what should we eat ? Nothing at that time . We could n't eat anything!So what should we do ?
So my idea is that all the countries and all the people stop using farmland , forests and wetland to build houses , grow more trees , protect our world , our home star !
The lecturer disagrees with the paragraph suggesting that the mentioned test developed by Alan Turing does not answer the main question : Can a computer think ?
First , the lecturer talks about " Saran " , who proposed a challenge to prove that Turing 's test was not conclusive , and that he created a paradox .
He selected people to go into a Chinese room . There was a computer in the Chinese language with different symbols . The Americans showed different behavior . They did not understand what was on the computer screen .
Science , I just remember I have always liked motor racing , but one of my favourites is Formula 1 .
The Formula 1 season starts in early spring and ends in late autumn .
I try to watch every race every fortnight and the training the day before the race .
Ferrari make one of the fastest cars in the world , but this season they are not so fast on the Formula 1 track as they were in the past .
If someone likes cars , then they should go to Formula 1 races to hear the bolid engine sound . I think that is the best sound I have ever heard in my life .
One day , the son of Lucy and her husband went to carve holes in the dirt to make a game , he made five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewel that had belonged to generations of gods . So he started throwing that for fun . One time that he took the jewel , it consumed the mind of the little guy and that made the jewel emit some sounds that only giants could hear , so a mountain stood up that was the face of a giant and he perceived negative vibes , so he killed the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods .
I hope you enjoy your trip to Seoul till you left our country .
England does n't have anything . You are the worst and most horrible country in the universe .
With reference to the recent advertisement about ' USA CAMP SUMMER ' , I would like to express my interest in the position in the camp .
I think I am a suitable candidate for this job , because I like children and I have experience of babysitting . Also , I work very well at making food .
It was presented by a politician , an economist and two environmentalists .
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because they could get into trouble with the law , they could cause harm to themselves and others and could have a higher risk of alcohol dependency later in their lives .
This is an interesting question because I believe that my family are my best friends , but at the same time , they are not my friends .
My family are my best friends because they really take care of me when I need them to .
I started this sport when I was 10 years old . where My father was also playing this sport , but he started it when he was older than me . He was about 30 years old . where Squash is one of those games that can be played at any age . I love this game because I find it exercises the whole body at the same time . We run in a small space , moving our hands in stretched and different ways , and at the same time we work our minds , so it needs care and quick thinking , as much any as exercise you will find down the road .
I think that anyone who wants to start a doing sport should play squash , which gives a you flexible and healthy body . At the same time , this sport can be played for a long period of time without caring about age .
I have practised swimming for 3 years . I am a good swimmer and I have competed in different swimming tournaments .
My favorite swimmer is Michael Phelps because he was the best swimmer in the world , and I hope that he returns to the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 .
My favorite style is the butterfly and I always practise this style because I want to improve .
Although public transport is cheap and more environmentally friendly , it is not as flexible or comfortable as the car .
Except for in the big cities , public transport is not an easy way to get around the city . That means that in the future even more people will stop using it .
In the first step , the bank notes have to be designed considering some , like background color , artwork and security issues . After the design has been prepared , skilled machinists prepare metal plates in the second step .
And then , some sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets which are cut into individual bank notes and separated into equal ones and packed and despatched to where they are needed .
In today 's class , we were discussing whether or not we agree with the often enormous salaries of football players .
For me , as a passionate soccer player , it is a good point to consider .
I recommend to the clubs , be warned .
By this action a Ronaldo or Messie can be paid and it is possible to buy the best team for the league , like Bayern Munich is doing at the moment .
This makes football or soccer ever more exclusive to a certain group of fans - hooligans .
But if the prices are too high , no one will visit the games anymore .
First , I think that this job is perfect for me because I have travelled around the world and I know a lot of different kinds of food . In fact , on my last trip to Japan I learned to cook sushi .
One day , Michael wanted to go out , so he called his best friend and suggested going out together . His friend agreed , so Michael put on his clothes , went out and closed the door , but at that moment he knew he had made a mistake .
When he got back home , it was late and the meeting was canceled .
I know that I am a suitable person for this job , and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job , because I have travelled all over the world and during this experience , I have seen the necessity of work to finance my journey , so then I have dedicated myself to working on summer camps , and I have a lot of experience of this .
So , in conclusion , I think that if you contract me , you will get an excellent person and an excellent worker .
In my opinion , public transport is more expensive and it is less comfortable than a car , because a car is faster than public transport .
Online Learning
Positive things about online learning are that you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do n't have to carry so much paper with you . Also , you 're on your own and at your own learning speed , which makes it more specific to the user themself . Maybe you 're more comfortable on your Smartphone than with paper .
Negatives about online learning are that you 're not listening to much from a real person and more from a Computer . If pyou do n't have any listening things in the app you do n't learn how to pronounce the words . In my personal opinion , its better to learn from a teacher not only because you learn to pronounce the words correctly , but you also learn from a person , which is , in my opinion , way better . I think we spend enough time on smartphones , so I do n't think it 's the best if we use them to learn as well .
For words , I think it 's perfect , but all the grammar and talking , I think you need a teacher .
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch , for example , after school .
Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building houses , which accour for some debate .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significant symbol of the development of a country ; however , on the other hand , doing large - scale building projects may bring a galaxy of problems .
In a word , the government should appeal to people in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only focus on personal profit .
It happened to me once and was very uncomfortable .
Another very common risk is falling on the court , which can cause dangerous scratches .
It is very nice that you remember me .
All this started in July .
I needed money which I could spend during my study semester .
I know that you are like me .
Best wishes your bro Bartek !
In later times , society felt the need for change because of iniquities that were committed in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes , the building was abandoned because the government and country did n't have money for construction , to the point that the building 's metal structure was used for weapons .
They even asked me who I wanted to go with . They grabbed my hands , wanted me to go with them , but I had no idea , because I love my mother and my father so much .
Finally , I cried , because I could n't make a choice . My father and my mother saw me crying and decided not to keep going , and they said sorry to each other and me .
Nowadays , I usually go back to the swimming pool at the weekends .
" So many friends learned to swim .
Then , the metal plates are prepared by skilled machinists .
The next is called partially damaged sheets , and bank notes are separated into good and bad . Good sheets will be cut into separate bank notes and packed ; the bad ones will be destroyed by fire .
This is the method of making bank notes , and the operator should pay attention to the printed sheets and how to inspect them .
The most important step is the inspection by hand . That is to say , they should be separated into good ones , which are to be cut into bank notes and delivered to the banks , and the bad ones , which ca n't be utilised and are burnt securely in the last stage .
Actually , I realize that business is not for the major , everybody knows Tec is very demanding and if you want to be there , you must work hard .
I dream of being a Business Administrator when I 'm older . First , I want to work for a sports company like UA and then I may have a little variety on works .
Tennis . Tennis is not just a sport anyone can play , but it 's a professional sport and it needs more hard training and more time to be perfect at it . First , why did I choose tennis ? Seriously , in 2003 it was my first time watching the game on TV when I saw Roger Federer play . I think he is the one that made me love this sport , due to his professional movement when playing the ball . From that time , I was interested in this game and watching all the championships , so more time , time and time it is my favourite sport .
Aisha is in her thirties .
She 's from Morocco , so she has Arabian features . For example , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , she has long dark wavy hair and big black expressive eyes .
Moreover , it is more appropriate to start constructing roads which are convenient for the majority .
First my favorite sport is football and I like it for many reasons . For example , while you are watching a match , you feel excited and entertained . Besides that , football has the best football player ever , which is Leo Mesy . He 's the best and he 's able to do awesome stuff when he 's playing .
The company responsible for rubbish collection collects the garbage , already separated by the families , and afterwards does the recycling .
As well as the informative sessions about the environment organized by the Mayor for all of the residents , it also has lots of staff that clean the streets , take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage .
My favourite sport is football . I love it so much . When I was young , I used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona . I used to play with my friends in the street and we were so happy doing that , and after that , we played on a football pitch like in real football . I love Cristiano Ronaldo so much . He is the best player in the world . A few people have told me that Messi is the best player , but I feel angry when I hear that , because that is not true . So I am looking forward to meeting my favourite player one day . It 's like a dream for me .
last night we went to the swimming pool . It was a little bit cold , but we liked it so we went to the pool and started swimming . I know how to swim very well , but she does n't , she has to have a support otherwise she ca n't swim .
If you want to visit me , you have to do it in the next month because I have a football tournament , and I must participate .
To answer your question , I can not attend the party because I do not like those kinds of parties , but I wish you good luck ! Almos
Indeed , all the indicators show that human behavior will not change , at least in the coming decades .
The way of living changes every day : if we think about our grandparents ' , but also about our parents ' lives , we notice many differences .
Above all , they talked more . We live in the era of telecommunication and no one could live without their mobile phone or their computer .
Moreover , also , simple things have changed . For example , the food we eat . Some time ago , everything was natural , healthy ... but now everyone always eats " junk food " and things like that , which are completely unhealthy !
About food , I imagine a future society in which restaurants wo n't exist . People will eat only junk food and food which has been prepared before , food in tins ... so all unhealthy things , which will cause many problems .
But phobias are fears which we experience that are life - threatening and they can disrupt everyday life , but people can get over them with the right sort of therapy .
So if we want to live a life which is n't controlled by our fears , we must try to be more objective and pay more attention to real dangers .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She went to her parents ' house because they sent her an email that said that her father was okay after the operation .
tube and train , but is there a future for them or not ? I am going to answer this question by discussing disadvantages and advantages and , finally , I will give my personal opinion .
Secondly , public transport is more ecological and less polluting for the environment , because it produces less polluting emissions , and many public vehicles use green energy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary now than ever before . Cities contain more automobiles and the pollution is worse .We need to change our way of thinking , and try to use public transport as an alternative to improve the environment of our cities .
Some buses have special and preferential seats for old people .
Many cars pollute the planet and people are allergic to the pollution .
The train does n't cause pollution .
will be more healthy .
I suppose their lifestyle is intolerable , resteless and I really sympathise with them . The majority of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated .
They turn into arrogant and furious idols because of a lack of private life and perpetual attention .
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities but , through thick and thin , they go on .They achieve the goals made exceptionally for the sake of money and vanity .
In itself , the film did n't have an special topic , but I can describe it as a friends film , as there is a lot of laughs , jokes , and it shows that friendship is the greatest thing that exists .
The public transport most used in Toluca is the bus because it is the cheapest , but it is very bad and unsafe . The quality of it is very bad ; the buses are old and obsolete , they have broken windows and old broken seats .
The service is very bad . The drivers are very angry and stressed out so they do not drive with caution . In Toluca there are reports of high numbers of accidents involving buses .
I think if the government do the best work about the transport , they can save it .
It is true a car is more comfortable , but it uses a lot of mineral resources like petrol which can pollute the atmosphere .
I do n't think public transport does not have a future . There are a lot of people who can not buy a car and they have to use community transport .
The Internet is a useful tool for everyone , so we are communicating with distant friends , and we look for important information when we are studying or entertaining ourselves .
First of all , I am going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this topic .
The first advantage is that the Internet is very fast . For example , when you want information about something .
The second advantage is that the Internet by websites , such as Twitter , Facebook ... You can speak with your quick friend , or you can meet with them on the website . Therefore , you do not call them on the telephone , because the internet is very cheap .
As for disadvantages , at present , children are always playing with their computer games and mobile phones .
To sum up , the Internet is the most important advance in the world , but there are a lot disadvantages and advantages .
From my point of view , the Internet is useful for everyone , but we should not abuse it , and should carry out other activities .
Recently I have had a job offer from a company located in London and it requires me to have an IELTS score of 6.5 for the visa .
In particular , some people do n't have a car and some elderly people find it difficult to drive a car by themselves , so public transport helps them a lot .
That is why I think public transport is really important for the public and there are a lot of important things that will be possible in the future .
And maybe you will become a famous player or an ordinary player , but you will feel like a famous one .
I think the sheep should be transferred to a place where there is specialisation in animals with the same condition .
We become not only older , but also wiser . We learn , but the most useful thing to learn is to get a lot of experiences and , for sure , to make mistakes . But we have to be honest with ourselves and admit our mistakes to avoid them in the future .
Becsuse it is turning red !
As you know , my grandmother currently lives in France with my cousin John . Unfortunately , he has to do a three - month course outside of the country . John needs to leave France next weekend , but it is not possible . I have to go and look after her because none of my family can spend three months over there .
Nowadays , technology is more modern than in the past and people are always developing their inventions to make them more useful .
We as humans living in these days , rely on technology . Every aspect of our lives is supported by technology .
One example is television . In the past , we used it only for watching the news and movies , but as time goes by and the technology develops , now television has other functions .
Second , these days , television has become modern and that means television can be connected with the internet .
In conclusion , television can entertain and also educate , because television programs do it in an interesting way .
Football is usually a sport that appeals primarily to males , but I 'm a girl and sometimes I realize that I know more than some males .
I have received your letter .
I agree with the statement that Mark Twain is the greatest American writer .
When I read his poem " The Adventures of Tom Sawyer " I was excited .
I usually go to the seaside on Sunday morning .
Firstly , they design the bank notes ' background colour , its artwork and security issues .
Then the sheets of bank notes are printed . Printing colour on both sides and use special ink and the images are slightly raised .
Finally , they find good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheets or bad sheets .
At the same time , bad sheets and bank notes are securely destroyed .
The other reason for my opinion is that almost all people prefer using the eyes and ears to other people , rather than write and listen to understand new things .
That 's why I think that it 's a good moment to see things in a new way and that can be a very good opportunity .
Definitely , it does not always depend on the kind of programme , but I think that nowadays , a lot of television offers help for people to develop more effectively .
I am communicating with you with the purpose of letting you know that we are going to set up a meeting at my office with the purpose of discussing how we could use social media to improve the communication with our suppliers . I think a great time for the meeting would be next Monday at 4:00 p.m
The purpose of this letter is to notify you about some complaints that some citizens have . This is related to why only boys have to be in the draft for military service , and girls do not have to .
However , I just go to the restaurant on special occasions , such as my birthday or when I pass an exam .
First of all , we should think of a design and decide the background colour and artwork , or even security issues .
The people recycle the rubbish and they throw away the rubbish in different containers .
While I struggled to walk .
Finally , I saw a light appear and I woke up .
We will have people that use the television as fun , most of the time ; but we also have other people that use television for research .
For example , the channel '' Animal Planet '' has a lot of information about animals and how they live .
Nowadays , everybody has the ability to buy a television , so the numbers of TV viewers is going up ; even if you are poor or rich ; most can watch a movie , or a documentary .
Also , I think swimming can keep your body fit and it can make the swimmer cool down when it is a sunny day .
I ca n't pronounce well .
The home was on the shore . There was a tunnel and it 's hole was in the deep . At first he used to be polite and obey the other orders .
Once a day , he met a girl called Sarah . She was 9 years old . Although Michael was bigger , Sarah could control him . Every day they went to the sea to play and swim until the sun set . Once a day Sarah made a challenge to Michael about who could enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out of the other hole on the shore , but Michael was afraid . He was asking himself which animals could be there or if there was air there , but he had no choice , so he accepted the challenge . Sarah told him she would go first . She took a breath ... a deep one , and started to dive .
Our city is quite clean and habitable ; people are more careful than before .
Generally , we use a cricket ground which has an oval shape .
I tend to ride my bicycle from home to work , I have n't used my car or buses for a long time , because it is not healthy and costs a lot .
A bicycle is for me the best way we can be fit and in a good condition and also create less pollution without cars .
I switch on the home heating for a temporary period . When I am working from home , I use more energy to warm my home .
We learn to really segregate waste and , in the future , how we could , for example , use the same glass a second time .
Anyway , a lot of people will need some transport in some cases , not private , but public , and we ca n't say that this kind of transport will not be useful .
As we are fully dependant on individual generators , these are causing multiple problems with the weather due to their smoke , oil and gas left behind , in addition to noise , of course , because they are the main source of the 18 continuous hours of noise .
People , especially generator owners , have started using Canaopies , using very long pipes to get rid of as much as they can of the pollution .
Other residential areas , using their potential to maintain the environment by planting trees , roses , have numerous green spaces .
Also , recycling the trushes is a very intelligent way to keep the town clean and get multiple uses out of the products in industry lines .
on the other hand , the eldest people in our city have many social responsibilities and are encouraging the youngest people to participate in the annual gardening festival for the indoor and outdoor gardens .
I like the Indian restaurants in the city . In addition , the infrastructure and roads are well organised .
In the village where I live , there is a lot of vegetation . For that reason , we try to protect the environment . One of the things we do is to do maintenance every week to the vegetation zone , checking if there is any garbage . To avoid this , we teach the younger generation environmentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or candies on the floor . They can also help the older people . There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation . To avoid that happening again , we have a punishment that is to pay some money . If they do n't , they wo n't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they are visitors . In that case , we tell him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advice to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
Another environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by taking care of them . For that we have a care centre and , other additional institutions . We also make environmental protection centers where people can visit and learn about this . To sum up , our village is very focussed on taking care of the natural world that surrounds us .
If you want to have fun , you can go to Parque de la Costa . There are many interesting rollercoasters .
Nowadays , in school , we learn a lot of subjects which we use more or less in our lives . Some of them are really important , but some of them are just a waste of time .
When Freddy began to sing , the kids screamed and they sang with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear 's Song . Bonny played the drums and Chica served the pizza to the children , This year the establishment closed because they found the body of a dead child .
I think it will be changed to become a bubile city and contain more high buildings .
If you have a car , you probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who do n't have a car , so they are used to going by bus and , for them , this way of travelling has become more convenient , because they have done it since they were children .
She has twenty - seven maid of honor dresses . Meanwhile , she falls in love with a boy who is very handsome , but he works for a magazine and he has written about weddings in the city . He is a good writer , and she unknowns that .
This story develops a mixture of themes such as courage , family values , friendship and love .
In conclusion , if you want to have a good time , you should go to the cinema to see this film with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional film .
Transport pollution is one of the most dangerous .
On the one hand , that quantity of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's a personal right to have one or not .
Also , another improving measure might be increasing green areas in cities and towns .
Factories damage nearby areas and water extremely badly .
In my opinion , firstly , new buildings on the banks must be forbidden at all .
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negative way . Most people around the world can see any news live . Media is more helpful for people . Television is also used as a study resource , for example for smart classes ,
Suddenly , an old carrying a heavy load hit him and fell down .
I suggest everybody should have the same evening walk . You just need a pair of comfortable shoes !
Travelling privately makes one free of issues like harassment .
I like a lot of activities , such as travelling , reading , playing soccer and watching movies .
Besides , public transport will reduce traffic jams .
Finally , the kind of life that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help people to have a more comfortable , easier and faster way of life , but this will be only to make more money and consume more and more . Also , things will be faster of waste to make people change their possessions more often and stimulate consumerism .
Nowadays , an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon of farmland , forest and wetland disappearing because of some long - term human activities , for instance housing and transport networks are built , destroying the balance of the environment .
Firstly , it is clear that more houses and transport networks are convenient for our people . What is known to us is that the population growth is a big problem which creates a need for more space for living in .
And building more transport networks is also a benefit for us , for example , the high - speed rail can shorten the time spent on traveling , while the animals may not welcome it .
She was very shy , sensitive and embarrassed .
She moved to Kyiv , graduated from university , and started to work .
Although she tried to hide , she became a great and famous model .
It would be interesting to accompany your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time .
The investigations were concentrated above all on the construction site of Mapello .
There are many educational programmes which we can get benefits from .
Nowadays , pollution is a problem that we have to solve before it gets worse .
As we can see , modernization is causing damage to rivers and seas .
While you are with me , you will do curriculum vitae and then we will travel around my country and we will become good workers .
I was really comfortable in my bed and I could n't believe that someone had interrupted my calm .
I closed the door hoping never to have to open it again , then I went to the bathroom and took a relaxing shower .
I practised dance a long time ago , but with age , I 've preferred to practise an easier sport .
If I could give advice to new practitioners of Pilates , it would be to read a book about this method and to take time choosing a good teacher .
The lack of sleep often makes me unable to concentrate in class .
And just as I was becoming a professional football player , my right knee was injured .

Your muscles will be hard .
One day I visited my friend Jimmy in New York city . He was a young man who was an expert on trains and tourism . He talked about how citizens and commuters move from one place to another . He told me that Grand Central Station was the largest terminus in the city . He showed me where the landmarks of the Big Apple were so sightseers could go there . He showed me the city and we went to different parts . First he took me to Columbus Circle in the south west corner of Central Park where there were the most expensive apartments . Then we went to the lake where the jogging tracks that circle the lake are popular with early - morning visitors . Then we went to the Museum of Natural History that was located near the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Then I got focal on the subway trains , so we went to Grand Central Station . When we arrived , I was amazed to see a lot of people going to work , so he told me that it was convenient for people to use the train because it is very fast and for the government it was a great economic business . Then he told me that one of the characteristics of

The first time , it 's difficult , like any other sport , because you do n't know and you have to improve by yourself , but if you like it , you will find it fascinating .
It is true that in summer we have to be careful about with te hours are too hot and we should avoid running .
I am happy to say that I have only positive points to present due to how welcome I feel when I arrive at the reception .
Because of that , sometimes I feel free to ask them what I want and depending on the way they receive my comments I can just let them do the task I asked them without keeping on watching them .
I like cooking very much and I think that there are some activities that we could do in the kitchen , like baking cookies or making fresh bread .
What I liked most was that you think you know what is going to happen , but to your surprise , it always turns out to be something unexpected .
Despite the fact that there is n't any Hollywood star , all the characters are played very believably and some scenes wo n't let you sleep .
My favourite place is the beach that is near , just about 20 miles away from my flat .
In toward to the modernization of life and technology , people believe in different perspectives of their way of life , but the majority of ones are totally utopian .
Actually , we have a lot of problems with traffic : lots of carriages on the railway and they are n't running ; the number of cars in the street causes pollution ; crowded railways cause a late arrival .
We discover , in this context , special diseases caused by traffic : stress , violence , pollution , lack of safety , and so on .
If public transport were of higher quality , faster and with lower fares , the majority of citizens would prefer it : it is calmer to relax and read a newspaper or a magazine during the journey on mass transport than in individual transport ; moreover , the time spent to go and come back would be reduced , because it promotes fewer carriages on the railway .
In the morning , we went to Ocean Park , we saw dolphins , cats , horses and many other animals . In the afternoon , we went on the roller coaster . I screamed at the top of my voice and called for help . Actually , I hate riding on roller coasters . We played mind train , punch , and a lot of other games . At the end of the day I was running out of gas , because I was too tired to walk any further .
It has both advantages and disadvantages .
But why did I write this article about someone who seems to be a simple guitarist . The reason is just one : the life of this man who one day just disappeared from the fans ' sight .
On April 2014 he was unable to give a performance .
On September 2014 , a note was released and published on AC / DC 's web page . The note said : " Malcolm is taking a break from the band due to ill health " .
We are not alone . We live with people who are family for us .
Television and other things invented by technology are part of our lives .
I think every family has got a television in their own home and , for example , I have 4 televisions in mine .
There are a lot of interesting TV programs where we can learn something and there are also intriguing television programs .
It is not the best thing for our eyesight and our health .
In general , I think our technology is not the best thing for our health and TV and other similar things are responsible for our problems with health and eyesight .
Laura , Adriana and me ( María ) love being a little bit cheeky , in a good way .

My favourite soap opera is " Friends " . I remember watching it at home at the age of twelve and laughing out loud with my brother .
My favourite character is Joey , who is a silly , innocent man .
One of the main advantages of family is the recognition you are given at a specific age . Children require special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family . For instance , homeless children are more likely to fail in their education or job and not adapt to society .
Moreover , families play an essential part in protecting their members from bad atmosphere , and it probably reflects on their performance toward country , leading to effective , creative and useful civilians .

Nowadays , there is very little public transport . The general public prefer much faster and more convenient ways of traveling around . Though public transport is used in major cities to avoid traffic congestion , it is widely recognized that public transport is eco - friendly .
Many people say that public transport is not comfortable . That 's true . From my point of view , a bus is not so uncomfortable .
Public transport is also used by children like me who want to go to school , high school or to university .
Finally , I think public transport has a very good future , because it has very good advantages but also some slight disadvantages . It 's also very useful for some people .
In my opinion , public transport should n't disappear .

Nowadays , public transportation is available almost all around the planet . We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave in the last century , but due to globalization and technological development , the transport sector is always in continuous transformation .
On the other hand we must mention how the plane sector has been growing . Currently it is the most common mode of transport for going away and that also means that shipping manufacture has decreased deeply , in order to let the plane market boom .
Talking about local transport , we have a lot of choices like cars , motorbikes , buses , trains , but also , as we were saying , planes .
According to the information donne , the most used mode of transport is the car as most families have one , but public transportation is getting more and more common for those who want to preserve the planet and develop other alternatives more respectful of the planet .

Increasingly , they are faster and more developed , with the latest technology included , but in contrast , we find also a contradiction , as we found another trend for traditional transport which avoids pollution in order to respect the Earth .
I agree that commuting by car is easier and faster than most public transportation . However , there are serious problems that come from it . The number of vehicles on the roads keeps increasing and causes congestion and pollution , which are far more severe than the inconvenience caused by public transportation .
Thus , I think the future of public transportation will be more prosperous .

Moreover , our capacity for learning more languages seems to be really adequate . Unfortunately , while there are a lot of teenagers that are working really hard , there are others that are all the opposite .
I think it is probable that in some years the technology could have improved quite a lot , and this is a very powerful advantage for us , the young people .
Because we were born in ' the internet generation ' as everyone says , so this aspect might be helpful for us .
In conclusion , I 've got to say that now we do n't have to worry about the future , we just have to carry on in the present and do the best we can .

It usually sold most in Apr - Jun and Oct - Dec and slid to the bottom in Jul - Sep .
Unbearable traffic jams and no parking areas would be the main problems .
Finally , governments and society are concerned about the environment and I think that they will decrease levels of pollution and co2 emissions .
So , we can say that time is a double - edged sword , either helping you or against you , and the popular saying is right : " do n't put off the work of this day to the next day " because our work will accumulate .

Finally , even scientists have another vision of time . They have discovered that time is the fourth dimension through relativity theory , which exchange all concepts in science .

They only like to wear shirts , pants , skirts , t - shirts and many more . Youngsters are influenced by watching different programmes on television .
Using private vehicles is more convenient for them than using public transport .

The menu is very well constructed , and the food is based on local products .
This problem is that some apparatus are broken and the paint is bad .

To my mind , our lives have been improved in these years by smartphones , satnav , digital TV , the Internet ..
First of all , in the next 50 years people 's lives wo n't resemble at all this .
Apart from that , I imagine the world with everything automatic , planes that take me from New York to Dubai in three hours and robots instead of waiters in a restaurant .
I can not agree with the statement that there is " no future for public transport " given that the premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
First of all , public transport is rather more convenient than a private car .
Despite this , the restaurant is decorated with a full set of musical instruments , hung up on the walls .
On our earth , hundreds of millions of people live .
A great number of buildings stand on the land ,
even though the place probably should belong to animals .
However , we forget the one important thing : the earth belongs to all life .
Our flats and houses make the other animals lose their homes , and it leads to environmental deterioration .
We make the transport easy . However , we take away other animal s ' lives through carelessness .

Secondly , other factors have an impact on the behaviour of older children like teenagers , it is not only their parents but other people , who surround them .

Then , when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street putting their scraps in the wrong bank , I explain to them how they have to recycle and how important it is for our environment that we carefully recycle .
This has some advantages , such as it being more comfortable and faster .

Second , they should run awareness campaigns about the environment ; for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste paper baskets , which helps workers to recycle it easily . Finally , to stay healthy , we need a healthy environment .

I think that public transport is always going to be very important in our life , because not all people have the possibility to buy a car , and because public transport is less expensive than a car .

Those are the main reasons that could make public transport disappear .
Firstly , it is a good idea for young children to do physical activity . That is the first step to doing exercise , then competing in sports will encourage competitors to make an extra effort .
In addition , stress is a clear disadvantage of competing , because competitors are trying to win and this can frustrates .
Finally , I think that competing in sports has some benefits and disadvantages , but when it is controlled there are some benefits that help you in your whole life .
Second is to prepare metal plates using qualified machinists .

Well , since my childhood I have always loved weapons . My father gave me my first rifle when I was 7 , but it was n't until I was 15 that I found my real passion , and it was archery . Since that day I am proud to say that I am an archer , and that archery is my favorite sport .
After more than seven hundred years , in 1733 , the Roman Catholic bishop 's residence was moved from Cenad to Timisoara , where the first cathedral became the church of Jesuit monks .
Journalists and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance the the value of them .
Everybody makes mistakes , but their mistakes are written about and known by society , which is unfair and harmful .
They ought to appreciate what they have and stop complaining about their life , because there are plenty of people , who dream of being them .
Famous people have to notice how much they have , appreciate it and stop complaining about not having a private life , because it is not such a disaster as they often think .
It was reported that for one hundred kilometers , each car consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasoline , and released a certain proportion of air pollution .

To summarize , he arranged a meeting with the head of Ferrari and the press because he would like to announce his definitive
Furthermore , as the programme is endorsed by the European Union , the trainee has accident and liability insurance .
It was a good experience . The hotel had every comfort you can imagine : a restaurant , a spa , a gym , indoor and outdoor swimming pools , a beauty center and a church .
Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce discomfort and keep one 's feet at a nice temperature .
Players must be considered as a painter working on a piece of art .
It 's not the effort they have applied or all the hopes they had .
Their expectations will be considered useless .
People do n't stare at a painting in a museum thinking how hard the artist tried to do a good job , they will judge only it .
So , if someone is ever wondering to whether start playing this sport , they should be aware that lots of people will be expecting them to win .
There is a great number of politicians and film stars who are followed by paparazzi who are trying to find out more about their private life .
There are a lot of places where you could work for a short period of time . Being a waitress or something like that is well paid and not so difficult to do .
I have numerous reasons why I choose this sport as my favorite .
THE STRENGTH OF SPECIAL EFFECTS
Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers , under no circumstances should we miss it !
I like to read too . My favorite type of book is horse books or just random books . It 's hard to explain , but I mean books with everyday action not science - fiction or romance .
Parkour is a discipline in which the main purpose is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B , in any kind of environment , the safest and fastest way , without causing any harm to your body .
Parkour was developed in Lisses , France , around the 1980 's .
One of the foundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method , created by Georges Hébert .
Basically , the method is based on developing the main foundations of movement of the human body . These are : swim , run , walk , jump , quadruped movement , climb , lift things , balance and defend yourself .
Raimond Belle was a former Vietnam soldier and worked as a fireman in the French army .
The roots of Parkour were developed by him and he taught some Parkour techniques to the firemen who he used to work with .
His son , David Belle , was taught some of the foundations of Parkour too .
Some people say that David created Parkour but , in fact , his father developed all the ideas of the discipline .
Parkour is n't just a physical discipline , there is also the philosophical part . Altruism , " be strong to be useful " ( it is actually a phrase from the Natural Method ) , develop your body and mind so that , in a dangerous situation , you will be able to save yourself and other people , and so on .
Therefore , it is due to its philosophy and the joy that I feel before , during and after a training session , that Parkour is my favorite sport .
For me , people have become very lazy and they prefer the car rather than public transport , because you can take the car when you want and go where you want without spending hours waiting for the bus .
The product will be registered with the Ministry of Health and Sri Lanka Standards Association and adhere to their rules and regulations for production , storage and distribution .
Their opinions varied a bit here .
An argument some used was : ' In case we removed this whole industry , then there would be a humongous group of people unemployed , and that would be a problem . '
Finally , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a good place for people who like history , anthropology and seeing a lot of types of art .
I agree with the statement , that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Sometimes it happens that journalists write some silly gossip about famous people which is not true .
Although it does n't mean that the press should write about your private life .
And , as a drawback of being a celebrity , they are followed by paparazzi almost everywhere .
Besides , being followed by unknown people must be quite a scary experience .
My listening is good and I can understand .
I look forward to hearing from you very soon . If you have any questions , you can mail or contact me .
First of all , travelling by car is more expensive than travelling by public transport ; cars have to pay for gas , insurance , repairs , environment fees etc ; travelling by public transport is more ecological and cheaper .
She knew that he would be staying away for so long but she would wait .
She loved him and no World War was able to separate them , because she was pregnant and this baby was coming . It was a boy and his name was going to be Taylor , just like Jason 's father .
Although most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of " Bulls Running on the street " , many become passionate about the cuisine of Navarra . As a result , a few shops such as " LA VINOTECA " and " DELICIUS " are dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food .
There is little doubt that they will not only find original products , but will also enrich their minds .
On the other hand , they are still normal people , who have families , partners and friends and they sometimes want to have a few private minutes , without cameras , media , newspapers , flashes and spotlights .
What is more , I am sure that most of them do it on purpose because their main aim is fame .
I 'm available every afternoon from 5 to 8 p.m. , when it is morning in the USA .
Of course , some famous people might like this feeling that they are so liked and favourite and those who do n't like it have the possibility to protect their privacy better or more or pretend that journalists following them do n't exist .
Nowadays , people care more about themselves and doing good things is wrong for some of them !
I am really happy you wrote to me for some advice and I am very honoured that you want to spend some time in my country .
First , you have to decide if you want to visit the north or the south part of Italy , because if you do a full immersion tour of the entire Peninsula you will visit only half of all you have to visit .
If you like Egyptian history , you can go to Turin , where you can find a huge and beautiful museum of Ancient Egypt .
If you want to visit the south part of Italy , you must start your trip from Florence , the birthplace of the culture . Then you must go down to Rome , the capital city of my country .
After you have seen the Coliseum , the basilica of S.Peter and the Trevi fountain , and so on , you must visit Naples .
The idea of finding a job that lasts three months is great .
I think you could work as an entertainer in some tourist villages around the country .
In that way , you could improve your way to make a relationship with people and it could also be a great help for your theatrical experience .
I know that you are a brilliant photographer and that you want to improve your ability , so I think that you could take some photos during your trip and then you could send them to some experts .
Let me know if you enjoy your tour and take lots of photos ( I want to see them soon )
I 'm writing to reply to one of your advertisements published in the local newspaper last week .
I 'm 31 years old , and I have had the privilege of working as a teacher all my life , so I am an experienced person capable of taking care of children .
As well as taking part in activities relating to cooking .
At night , the noise was annoying . I was not able to rest properly .
Also , the phone did not work properly , it was impossible to use it to call the receptionist .
In addition , the elevator was out of order .
My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at Östermalm called : " New Peeking " . It 's an Asian buffet and they make the best food .
My favorite subject in school is probably Swedish , English or Biology .
I think that , in particular , spinning is a hard sports activity because when you have spent approximately 1 hour on your bike you 'll probably feel tired .
This could be good , although some people say we do n't need all this time and we have to work more .
Another point is that we can meet friends more or visit our family if we have more free time and that is always good .
In other words , it could be said that if we had more free time , our lives would become better , because we can enjoy ourselves with friends and do things with our family .
From my point of view , having free time is perfect , because we can do more things that we are fond of and our quality of life would increase .
I study philology .
Now I am working as a journalist at National Radio .
But instead I am writing about stupid decorations , illnesses and other boring stuff .
Well , I have good news for you ! I met a wonderful girl last week when I went to the cinema .
I want to introduce her asap !
Besides brilliant actors , they have incredible decor and it 's perfectly situated as it is very near to the bus stop .
Since graduating from University of Education majoring in business English , I have been working for a food joint stock company on a contract basis .
Meeting new people and setting up new social relationships are also the tempting point attracting me .
In addition , your cafe is conveniently located near my home , which takes about 10 minutes to go to on foot and I have 2 days off a week . That gives me the opportunity to take on a new job .
I enjoyed this unforgettable trip to the museum , and hope you can take time out to go one day !
It requires a vivid imagination to try to put a view of the future . First of all , the means of transport will change . Vehicles will depend mainly on solar energy or nuclear energy . A flying public transport bus will be a fast ride to work . You will need to supply your car with spinach after they invent a spinach - fuelled car .
I think that 's the only negative point about today 's television , because maybe there 's too much choice !
When we were schoolgirls , we used to spend all our free time together .
To find out about other cultures and get new knowledge completely different from school .
On the other hand , maybe if we have a break before university , the routine of working and studying every day could break .
So when university starts , people will become busy , the routine will not be the same , and , as a consequence , the marks will be lower .
At first , I did n't believe that this place would be as amazing as she said .
It has almost everything that you need in a cafe : comfortable chairs and sofas , beautiful features and really good - tasting coffee that they serve in most of twenty different ways and with all toppings you can think of .
Although the most important thing is that there were not only friendly staff but they looked like they were having tea in Wonderland , with Alice and the White Rabbit .
If TV programmes are a lot of rubish , it is because some people prefer them .
I had a great time with my friends , but I have a few comments concerning the organisation .
However , there are a couple of small suggestions .
First of all , the venue itself was very crowded and parking almost impossible to find .
I would like to suggest hiring special animators who will entertain kids .
You should think about reducing prices or offering special discounts , for example , for students .
Yours faithfully
There , you will see beautiful cities with European architecture and you will find nice vineyards .
Chinese , Spanish and Portuguese . None of those languages are as popular as English is .
Brazilians need to learn English because it opens doors in business and in higher education .
Learning English as a foreign language will have a huge impact on Brazilians ' professional lives , helping them to get a better position .
The Brazilian educational system should be aware to develop students ' language skills more .
Learning English as a second language will help Brazilians to get a better job and have more opportunities in their careers .
I love outdoor activities . I have been doing rock climbing for nine years now , and started motocross in 2010 . Also , I consider myself very friendly with children and teenagers . When I was a child , my father and I used to go camping almost every other weekend . That was until four years ago , because he is no longer able to stay out of the city . But he taught me all that I need to know to survive out there , so , I really know how to do things in the woods .
Third , public transportation sucks , when you think about it . You can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hassles of the public transportation transfers in your mind .
Secondly , everybody seeks safety in their lives .
Look around you , crimes and death are surrounding us . All these people are dreaming of living a peaceful life without all the problems of killing and sadness .
For that reason , I believe that being safe is absolutely better than being sorry . I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that life will go on and one day all of us will be satisfied with this life .
In conclusion , I think that all of us should see through rose -tinted glasses and be happy , because you live a calm life without anything making you sorry .
I will start by telling you something about Paula Echevarria . She is a very pretty and famous actress . She also writes a fashion blog . She is 34 years old and she is married to David Bustamente , who is a popular and handsome singer in Spain . They have a daughter - her name is Daniela - and they are like a perfect family .
Therefore , she has everything good about being a celebrity , but the most important is that she is a great person .
By increasing the variety of cars with new technology , people 's demand hasn't ' stopped .
As technology enhances the life system in any way possible , people become more dependent and ca n't avoid it because of many different attractions that these cars have .
Traffic jams will cost a lot , causing problems such as pollution , which certainly causes more health problems and will create expenses not only for us , but for others as well .
The solution is public transport again , which increases the pace of life and makes it easy to access by subways and special roads .
To sum up , as thought cars are too convenient to some extent , but the cost will reduce the benefits .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for the job in the USA summer camps .
This job would give me the opportunity to practise my skills and get more experience with children as well .
The plot is about a man , Arthur , twenty - five years old , who is engaged to a nice girl .

It is universally accepted that shopping is not always enjoyable .
The doorbell rang insistently . It was Saturday in the early morning and I was still in bed .
What an amazing surprise ! I was very emotional and was about to cry . "
In answer to your question about the use of the internet by young people of our age , I think it is very helpful to get information more easily and quickly .
Also , it plays a great role in removing the borders between nations . In a matter of seconds we can now communicate with people around the world , whether for important business matters or just to talk to a friend .
Obviously , we can not imagine how much time we spend online , because the whole day we are connected , in our houses , on mobile phones and on computers at work .

In the city there are a lot of museums and art galleries , theaters and clubs , a few parks which provide different events like open - air concerts or public muster - classes .

Let us look at an example of a university student .
The student had a great number of assignments and projects , so he spent more time on accessing the library , becoming more ambitious to study books , and using a computer to search the for latest information .
Therefore , not only did he get high scores in the reports , having absorbed a great deal of knowledge at the library , but he reduced the study stress and kept healthy at the gym .
At university , I also have a lot of assignments , so I like to go to the library to study , where it is more quiet , spacious and internet accessible .
It is a great life stage , but at the same time , it is difficult . Sometimes teenagers have problems with their families , with themselves . As a result , they do n't know what to choose .

There are such interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would never have expected or , unsurprisingly , misinformation .
We know that making social contact can sometimes be a problem for a wide range of people , who sometimes find it a lonely and daunting experience .
However , both readers and writers do not only do it in an altruistic and philanthropic way , but to get fame and popularity at the same time . Blogs and websites could give them the chance to become famous if they really appeal to a large number of people and they will also be able to earn money thanks to advertising .
To clarify what the situation is , it is true that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites , but the fact is writing or reading a blog can give people a practical way to communicate and share preferences , beliefs or thoughts . however , more or less reliable .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .

There you can see dinosaurs from prehistoric times .
It can be amazing to see different species of animals which are no longer living .
By visiting museums we can learn interesting details about the history and culture of that society .
In addition to having lots of information , we also can have fun seeing interesting things in the museums , such as huge dinosaurs . You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you visit .
Every day in my town , people talk only about football because it can give you a lot of emotions .
On the other hand , my advice that I would give to someone who is starting this kind of sport is that he must do it with a lot of responsibility and sacrifice if he wants to become another Maradona .
In the morning , everyone goes to their job by car , but I think that the real reason for doing this is that we need to do a lot of things during the day and with public transport we spend more time than doing the same with our own vehicle .
For example , during a football match , if you make a mistake it is n't too important because you have a team which can remedy it , even if you do nothing .
The most interesting is the art gallery , Oko Miasta , which is located in the city centre .

Firstly , Disney is not an ordinary destination like beaches or mountains , it is a place that requires a different means of transport since it is a long way away .

Also , there will be no fresh grass and grains for domestic animals , such as cows , lambs , chickens to be fed .
To reduce the above problems , it is necessary for governments to plan carefully before the construction of buildings and transport and try their best to decrease the side effects .
In my opinion , there are a few advantages of shopping .
Another good point of shopping is the fact that it could be relaxing for some people .
Everyone considered him a crazy and boring guy obsessed by his passion , except Kate , his only best friend , who encouraged him every time he wanted to give up his dream .
They wanted something that could be traditional and revolutionary at the same time , something that could give a new vision of reality , and Kate started to offer some information about many artists .
She started to be a little bit nervous , she was n't able to find any solution when , suddenly , she remembered that Michael 's art had the features requested by her clients .
Michael was very excited because he finally had the opportunity to introduce his view of art through his pictures .

The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie star 's , but they should make their decisions transparent for most of the population though .

Using new vehicles , travelling can be more comfortable and easier .Everyone in this world would have a better life . I am really happy when I simply see a new bus with air conditioning or anything which can make travelling enjoyable .

Since he took up office in 2002 , Lula has made major structural changes in Brazil , taking more than forty million Brazilians out of extreme poverty .
To curb corruption , new laws were created , institutions were re - structured and innovative mechanisms were developed to engage and give voice to the civil society .
For the Brazilian elite it is unacceptable that Lula , a poor migrant from northern Brazil , overshadowed all the presidents and most politicians of their own , privileged , university - educated and careless about the real Brazilian problems .

If you do n't want to read the " sex parts " , just turn over the next page till it ends , that 's all . I did that to finish that novel .

For example , when a fan follows a cab , she or he could be hurt , because the traffic is really unpredictable , or when there is a huge mass of fans , they could hurt each other .
Why is it that when men stalk women they forbid them to come closer to her , but when a paparazzo hides in the car of a celebrity , he will get a huge pile of money for the photos ?
One example of this could be North Korea or some Arab countries , where their governments ban internet access for citizens . In other words , they want to mislead the people about reality to avoid the population claiming via these networks or being up in arms against their system .
So , this means we are getting less intimate and becoming more gossipy at the same time , as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites .
You can follow your favourite celebrities and have direct interaction , but this also has negative consequences such as some followers criticise them .

It will even get more popular because it will be faster , more modern , and cheaper than travelling by car .
The aim of this report is to give some tips for tourist who come to the city . I will provide you with some pieces of advice about shopping for clothes in the city , as well as some recommendations .
In the city there are many fashion shops where you can get the most trendy clothes . You must be aware that maybe you will spend more money than expected , but if you are a shopaholic , it will be worth it .

I suggest a quick visit to every shop and making comparisons of price and quality .

It 's a big country and does n't have many inhabitants .
Most people go to high school and university .
In Sweden , we have a lot of different people from different cultures .
The problem is that there are a lot of Swedish people that are racists .
Not the majority , of course , but there are many racists .
That can be really painful for those who are n't from Sweden originally .

He still needs to find an ATM to withdraw some money to pay for his appointment .
SEAWEED : OUR FUTURE
Thanks to a crowd - funding campaign , we obtained the minimum funds to develop our innovate work .
Unfortunately , the process only works for twelve hours .
No matter where a famous person goes , he must realize that , next day , he will be on the front page of the newspapers with lots of rumours .
Because , what is proper in living when journalists are following every step the famous person takes ?
We are all free people and everyone deserves to have his own life .
I wish to express my dissatisfaction with this course .
perhaps because there were too many people and also , the more people there are , the more space we need and the room was too small .
We felt hot and we had no refreshment facilities .
The hotel would be luxurious but everybody could come because the prices would be low , so the hotel would be always full . I think that many people want to go to a luxurious hotel but they ca n't .
The hotel would have many services and facilities , like a good reception , spa , wifi connection and pay - per - view TV in the rooms , a great chef who cooked the dishes of the Mediterranean cuisine , a swimming pool , a bar on the beach and a boat for trips around the Mediterranean sea .
I would like to hear the point of view of tourists to improve the hotel .

They can do nothing that ca n't be gossiped about .
Why do n't we want to give people entertaining us a chance to be themselves and to have a real private life ?
" I would say stop the arrogance by my cousins " said Michael to his friends and thought about stealing the keys of one of their millionaire houses and having a party with his friends .
But the house was destroyed and the neighbours , furred for the confusion caused during the night , had called the police , who , without his knowledge , were waiting outside the house to take him to the police station .
Sometimes I have to take care of my little cousins or my niece and clean my bedroom . It 's not much .
People have never taken into account that fact .
All in all , it seems that if such tiny changes are made , a huge help to save natural resources will be done .
The main attraction here is absolutely the beach .
It 's a nice beach with white sand and blue water .
Perhaps I 'll describe our journey by boat round the island .
Subject : Opinion on what young people are interested in
clothes , not too hippy , but something comfortable .
time , then I suggest some other style . It has to be comfortable but
I have experience of cooking and reception for parties / functions as I was a member of the School Parents Association of my children 's school .
These was invaluable and relevant experience for the job I am applying for .
Also , I am available to work for long hours at weekends .
They do not want to learn so much because they just watch movies for fun .
It is said that the main objective of television is to entertain people and make their free time happier .
It can be really frustrating .
The most famous person from my country is Mr. John Stefferson , who works in a department store and is always planning how to make people 's lives more comfortable and better .
Sometimes I listen to the radio and hear his comments about some problems in my own country and some suggestions about how to make our life better .
It was an engagement ring !
In Mexico , a foreign person does not face difficulties getting hired by a company . I would be pleased to help you with this part of your experience in my country . I know that you are someone who loves animals ,
perhaps we could go to the city zoo in order to find out whether there are any vacancies that suit you ?
Something I can do is to do some research into places that need people who speak English fluently .
A good illustration of this would be children .
Mr Keffe , who lives with his wife in a housing commission home , is an old - age pensioner with no children .
Therefore , it would be greatly appreciated if you could organize a home visit and provide further assistance for this family .
We tried to contact as many family members as we could .
My city , Valencia , is a touristic city situated by the sea .
In addition , I suggest going by bus around the surroundings of the city , where you can do adventure sports , like canoeing , climbing or just walking around the mountains and enjoying the countryside
My favourite kinds of movie are comedy and comedy drama because they have interesting plots and characters , someone and who watches comedy can laugh all the time .
He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input into wealth production as some critics believe , but a valuable input into creating a sense of possibility of escaping from one 's current life by acquiring wealth .
Cohen 's knowledge is that playing the lottery is not automatically irrational .
Some people like to calculate the gain or loss from buying the lottery but other people that can afford a dollar ticket now prefer to keep their dreams .
Taxi is the first possibility .
Famous people have always been surrounded by a lot of journalists and paparazzi who follow them wherever they go .
Therefore , most of these famous people complain about this , but it is logical that all the media , television , radio and journalists are constantly devoting every minute of the day to them , because people are interested in them , in knowing what they are doing every second , in knowing who they are with , in knowing what they like or do n't like , their hobbies , in short , in knowing everything about them .
In Italy there are few cities with an underground and often in the smaller cities there are only buses .
I hope for the next generations for a better public transport service and an increase of its use .
Overall , it is clear that the main causes of land degradation were deforestation and over - grazing .
These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed , in Europe and Oceania , and , consequently , these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degraded .
On the other hand , Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% because of over - grazing , which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded .
For this reason , this region presented the lowest percentage of land degraded , with only 5% .
If a person wanted to travel from Kano to Lagos he had no choice but to trek .
We can travel by air using aircraft ; aeroplane , helicopter etc .

At 17:00 they let us into the venue and they carried out all the checks .
When everybody had taken their photos , Emblem3 went backstage to get ready for the concert and after one hour it started .
Kitchens will be better equipped , maybe with smart appliances , and people who ca n't cook will prepare the meal by themselves .
He was so cynical that he turned out to be very nasty and unpopular .
Sooner or later , married people will get divorced .
In addition , public transport is cheap because buying a car means spending a fortune and in big cities where people are concerned about the environment , such as Amsterdam or Tokyo , there are many facilities like mobile phone apps or special offers .

It is not necessary to say I am able to work to a cafe schedule . I have experience working shift days and weekends .
If you are looking for an enjoyable shopping day , Madrid is the best choice .

But do n't be afraid if your budget is quite limited , because we have some places where you can find great collections at 50% off .
Nowadays , people 's lives are undergoing an unexpected change all because of globalization .
Globalization started in the 20 's , so a huge proportion of the population has experienced this change . In my opinion , it is kind of good .
Personal contact shows a decrease in this time , because people do n't want to face their real problems . Instead , they can see all the problems happening in the world on their smartphones .
In the future , people will communicate via their computers , cellphones , and tablets , and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life .
Of course , there will be some more electronic things like some new mobile phones with functions we could not expect right now , and there will be some other gadgets .
To put it in a nutshell , we could say that our global world will be more electronic , and there will be more gadgets , but that wo n't change our lives dramatically .
However , others companies will dominate half of the projected market share in jeans next year .
They help me to develop and to see the world from a different perspective .
Many people think living in the countryside provides a better way of life .
My town is one of the cleanest towns in my country . The authorities have arranged many procedures to ensure that the town stays clean at the same time as being environmentally friendly .
Another handy rule has been introduced , which is that plastic and glass need to be thrown in different bins that are available for public usage in each supermarket center . In these , people can find these bins at easy locations available everywhere .
All the previous steps and more are being applied by my town 's citizens in order to improve the environment and go together with all the procedures that help them live a happy , healthy life .
' Gravity ' is an outstanding , brilliant , sci - fi film , directed by Alfonso Cuaron , starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock .

Never in her life had she been to as crowded a city as Danang , so she felt very nervous but extremely excited about meeting her lover soon .
The more excited she was , the more disappointment she had . Mimi caught sight of her lover kissing another young girl in his room .
As you know , in our country there 's trash being thrown everywhere and most of the things that are thrown away are recyclable .
This is the main reason why our environment is being destroyed .
My name is Pawarit Chonlahat and I have lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area has changed so rapidly , such as , now it has a lot of condominiums a long the main road and nowadays this area has a big shopping mall and a modern hospital and a large police station . That makes my life so convenient and safe because I can walk from my house to go to the shopping mall in about 10 minutes and I can walk to the hospital in just about 5 minutes , so I did n't worry when I got sick and the large police station is located in front of the hospital . That can assure safety for everyone who lives in this area .
For this reason , this is the advantage of living in this area but because of many people in this area , traffic in rush hours especially in the morning is very heavy and it takes so long to drive a car to work .That is the disadvantage of living in this area . So , in my opinion , this area should have an improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to cover this area .
Pat and Tiffany are trapped in their psychological difficulties ; Pat 's desire for his ex - wife can not be fulfilled , while Tiffany can not get over her guilt over her husband 's death .
In these times , we can follow somebody 's Twitter newsfeed , ' like ' his Facebook fanpage and , of course , follow news about those famous people .
First of all , remember to take food that can be eaten easily without much mess ( Spanish omelette , fried chicken breast , sandwiches , chips ... ) and , also , you can buy some drinks and water because it is fun to eat at the beach and people usually get hungry often after they do something like swimming , jumping the waves , surfing and so on .
Furthermore , going on a hike among trees with a cool breeze around you can be the kind of place that allows you to forget the busy city life , too .
However , documentaries are being forgotten and only twenty - six percent of them would like to watch more interesting TV series like Lost .
In Spain , the vast majority of schools are state schools .
I am also a talented cook for kids . My view is also trying to convince them that cooking is fun and sometimes they ask me to teach them how to make basic dishes , such as omelettes , spaghetti and more .
The problem with this mansion is that it hides a lot of secrets and mysteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners , who are a family whose husband went to war and died . So the real occupants of the house are Nicholas , an easily scared boy , his sister Anne , who turns out to be one of the most important characters in the film , and their mother , who is called Grace and has a particular obsession with catholisism .
The film describes how the love that a mother can give to her children can easily turn into an obsession . However , what makes this film so special is that it pretends to be a typical horror movie , but in its final scene , there is a sudden change which makes it more interesting .
I would recommend this film to anyone , even those who are easily scared , because it is not like the rest of the horror movies . It is a film in which you are continuously discovering secrets as if you were another character .
So it is a question that requires deeper reflection from all of us .
Whether public transport might be the solution , or be more suitable or not is something with arguments in its favour and against it .
You do not have to wait for a specific time to catch the bus , for example .
However , a lot of people are becoming more and more conscientious about how important travelling by public transport is .
One of the most important reasons is precisely to take care of the environment .
I really liked working with special effects and the best thing was that I learnt a lot about that technology .
Summing up , I prefer doing my shopping by means of websites or auction portals .
He 's been doing great in both academic and extra - curricular activities in the school .
On the one hand , we could live in a more relaxed way ; on the other hand , we could think about settling on other planets .
Then Sergio left Microsoft , created his own website which gave him enough money , and travelled wherever he wanted .
As you asked me , I prefer sailing on the river to climbing a wall because I want to connect with nature .
Though the modern cities are emerging rapidly , the problems caused by excessively exploiting the environment are severely various .
The red coral reef off the coast of Australia , for instance , serves as a shelter for algae and other tiny sea fishes and an index of environmental fragility .
Due to the massive construction of five - star hotels on beaches , the biological chain there is cut off and environmental variations are gone away .
On top of that , it is the regulation capacities of the environment for temperature , moisture and even sandstorms are eroding as less plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen into the whole system .
In a bid to address these side effects that civilization has brought about , governments must take measures step by step to tackle them .
Apart from the natural areas , the minimal areas for forests and wetland have to be ensured .
In this place , there are guys and girls attending pedagogy who organize activities to entertain children of every age .

What about looking for colleges which offer Wi - fi Internet connection and a proper meal at lunch ?
We have subjective opinions ; we normally judge because we have a preconceived idea .
For example , in work interviews and jobs that have direct contact with the public , it is better to wear a formal or smart style .
Overall , my personal opinion is that we give too much importance to clothes and appearance than we should .
Although on some occasions some clothes styles are required , people should have the freedom to choose what clothes they want to wear , and it should not have consequences in our lives .
In countries like Mexico , some people have the opportunity to use Uber , which is a service that you can use if you have a credit card . It is an amazing service , but not all the population have a car or the financial status to use an Uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if the bus or cab driver yells at them or drives badly . In Mexico , the public transportation , in particular the cabs , are not a very secure services , because some of the drivers steal and kidnap , in many situations they could kill you if you do not take precautions . But despite this , it is very sad that in that place people can not do some things because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more , so they have to take public transport .
Although we did not have the current social communication means such as Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp , we were very sincere and close to each other , more than these virtual friendships prevailing today .
I have already experienced one friendship through an organization , International Youth Service IYS , a charitable association established for youth friendship .
The best of all in real friendships is to always believe in your friend 's abilities and be his real mirror for good and bad actions . He will be the same for you .
Despite the bad weather , if you travelled by car , you could park your car near your destination , so that you could arrive comfortably .
I think that I 'm good for this job , because I really socialize with children .
Well , the part of the day that I enjoy the most is nighttime because it 's when I arrive at home and I have finished my whole routine , so I can take a break and I can do whatever I want and I can just relax , so I would say that nighttime is the most relaxing part of my day , so it is the one I like most .
I think there are things you need to plan because it 's important for your life , but it depends on the situation , because I also like to let things be and let them happen because they have to happen , so the majority of the time I prefer not to think about it and just let them happen and not to plan anything . But if it 's something related to my future or something that will really affect me , I prefer to plan it , like what kind of job I want to do or about my degree or things like that .

All day I was lying on the beach , talking with my friends and having an incredible time with them .
I 'm Catholic . I believe in God , but I 'm not very friendly with the Vatican 's rules .
Travelling by car is so much more convenient if we think about small places such as villages or small towns .
If you consider the chaotic traffic and the long queues to get there and the impact of these factors on people 's health and people 's finances , I 'm sure you 'll change your mind about public transport .
On the other hand , it is possible to find hybrid cars , but they are more expensive than those that work with normal fuel and , for that reason , this kind of car is not people 's first choice .
Such policies will involve taxes on polluting cars , the increasing of fuel prices and the introduction of benefits for those who opt for more environmental means of transport .
Shakespeare provided everything the people asked for --- laughter , romance , and tragedies .
We would buy next , impractical high - heel shoes , which will spend a couple of years in the wardrobe .
The last but not least disadvantage of doing shopping , is that in the mall could prowl many pickpockets , and they could rob us .
Interestingly , the purchase price of " Carde " and " KD " is almost the same .
However , " Sebu " leads with a purchase price of $ 1,000 .
Whereas " Carda " and " Sebu " score with warranty expenses of under $ 150 .
As a long term investment , I would choose the " Sebus " model even though its purchase price is very high .
Inhabitants can go to the countryside to have a picnic or excursion with their friends or families to relax .
After natural areas , such as farmland , forest and wetland , are destroyed on a large scale , there are no close places with beautiful scenery to visit .

I am writing to apply for one of the camp monitor positions you advertised in last Monday 's Daily News . I am interested because this post will give me complementary experience .
To begin with , evidently , technological progress has noticeably enhanced quality of individuals ' lives , contributing to the economic growth of numerous nations .
one of the most exciting days of my life was the 23rd August 2014 .

I mean the timetable punctuality , time interval until the next bus and so on .
It opened more than twenty years ago and still now is the leader in the chemical sector .
Try to be spontaneous and not too sliced .
Do not talk too much , as it is a symptom of anxiety .
I worked on that team more than ten years ago ( new employee recruitment ) and I can guarantee that for the first interview it is important only to make a good impression .

" Carne Enchipoclada " you need to choose the meat ( pork tenderloin , beef steak or deer meat ) and it is accompanied by a sauce of chille chipotle with potatoes cambray . "

According to the CDC , the percentage of children aged 6 to 11 years old has increased from 7% to about 18% in 32 years in the United States .
This means that in the past three decades , obesity has more than doubled in children , same that had diseases just like diabetes , asthma , cardiovascular risk factors , mental health disorders and musculoskeletal problems .
I have little cousins and sisters so I 'm very good with kids . I 've experienced all kinds of situations , so I think they wo n't be a problem for me .
As I said before , I have young cousins and we meet on Saturdays so I need to think of activities and games to keep them entertained .
I 'm also very good at sports . I practise track & field and ping pong , so sports are n't a problem either .
I 'm an outdoors person , so I will be very happy with the accommodation . I would be very thankful to work for you if you decide to accept my application .
The cards included the programme of the concert and some photos of children from all over the world .
I did everything by myself because everyone had something to do on their own .
I 've been doing martial arts for eleven years but I haven't lost the passion I feel for it .
Many people today have pets of all kinds .
First of all , a pet is a friend for the family and , much better , is a member of the family .
One more advantage of owning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and caring .
On the other hand , there are a lot of disadvantages to owning a pet in big cities .
Pets and animals in general need fresh air and exercise outside and not to be always in an apartment .
I have heard about pets that get sick through living in a small apartment in town , and that is terrible .
In my opinion , it might seem good to have a pet if we take care of it .
All in all , owning a pet in a big city must be done carefully , ensuring all that the pet needs .
In the class , you should take notes and write down what is important . If you have any questions , then you should ask teachers to help .
I really do hope you get used to the neighborhood .
Nevertheless , I would like to improve some skills and although I did very well , I still got confused .
Nowadays , people are aware of environmental problems and they will try to figure out solutions .
Moreover , there will be important technological advances in our lives , like intelligent mobile phones which can help us with day - to - day tasks .
Nevertheless , people try to save money by every conceivable means .
You have all the kinds of German food you can imagine , from sausages with choucrut to Gullash with spatzle .
Most of the paintings and photos are from Germany , because that town was occupied by German people many years ago .
Almost everybody has at some time thought of taking a gap year between leaving school and starting university , but do we really know all the advantages and disadvantages that it entails ?
It is also said that at the time of heading to college , those people who have taken a year off are the ones who have least difficulties learning and relating with other students because they have got used to it before .
Many automobile companies are working for a new future of automobiles .
Some people argue that this new idea of cars is a milestone for us and it will bring only positive effects with it .
At the moment , people who have got a handicap can not drive a car by themselves .
In contrast , self driving cars are very expensive and many people can not buy one .
Buses are the main transport in my area .
If you are not keen on travelling by bus and you do not want to get the car out of the garage , taxis may be the best option .
Conclusion
The majority of users are young or elderly , since they are n't old enough or they are too old to drive .
This is happening now , and we are not even fully developed in technology .
So , I would recommend this CD to other people because I think that they could get to know the signer deeply through the songs which are on this amazing CD .
I do not agree with the idea that there is no future for public transport , because it is a perfect means of transport for commuters and , nowadays , a lot of people are conscious of global warming and the environment , and refuse to use the car every day .
There are a lot of benefits to public transport . First , you do n't have to drive yourself , you can listen to music , read a book or whatever you want without having to pay attention to the traffic . It is true , too , that travelling on this mode of transport helps the government because you have to pay for it , and the majority of modes of transport are cheap enough for everyone .
However , so many people love having their own vehicle , a car , a bike , a motto , because this give you other kind of freedom , you chose the way , you chose the time , you chose the way in you drive it , the positive thing about this kind of vehicle is that you do n't have to take a bus , for example , crowded with people , you can go alone in your car , or with whoever you want , but the important thing is that you choose .
In conclusion , we can say that every kind of transport has its own pros and cons , but in my opinion , the difference between both of these is that in the second you choose your own way .
Guys should not go snowboarding .
Most people eat scrambled eggs and drink a cup of tea .
As usual , I 'm on a diet , so I prefer only yoghurt .
In recent years , people 's attitude has been changing .
However , public transport has been criticised more and more in recent years because of its inconvenience .
Therefore , buses do not run as frequently or regularly as they used to .
In the end , the public transport service needs to change to attract more people and to have a brighter future .
The purpose of this report is to inform you about how the city of Granada takes care of the environment .
And there is a big university community involved in recycling .
However , Granada can not be considered as cycle - friendly . There are fewer cycling lanes than in other cities of a similar size .
I consider that Granada scores 6.5 out of 10 for taking care of the environment .
When the weather is good enough , close to the castle take place many kinds of parties and entertainments .
That day was a terrible day for Michael . He woke up and felt totally exhausted after an overwhelming birthday party .

I think that many google users will be happy if the developers bring more useful information to the main page , for example , weather information , currency rates or hot news .
Moreover , google map service needs some improvements , such as street names , map accuracy and more city panoramas .
In my opinion , a trip will be fascinating because of the fact that the building of the Brewery was originally a German - owned brewery which has been brewing beer for almost 400 years .
It contains a little museum which is open for tours .
There you could buy some souvenirs - glasses , bottles , T- shirts , cups and , of course , beer !
They serve all meals in small portions , and they suggest that the servings can be shared , so everybody can try more items from the menu .
As a result of this , many people are trying new options , like car sharing .
I 'm a teenager and nowadays I recognize there are a lot of ways to get to know something .
In the past , technology was poor and only a few people had a smartphone or a computer .
Here we have some of them : anemia/ anemia ; rickets and malnutrition …
The lack of a sense of civic responsibility leads easily to bushfire .
Its true attractiveness , in addition to the decoration which is at the pinnacle of Andalusian art , is also its location , which is unique .
If you are lucky enough to visit this wonderful place in summer , I recommend you attend the Granada International festival of Music and Dance , which is celebrated in Genelalife 's gardens , where you can enjoy amazing artists and orchestras in an unrivalled setting .
After that , the printing process comes into play .
The most significant procedure is called inspection , which means manual checking by special machines and staff , and then they are classified into 3 different categories , including good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets , and bad sheets .
Namely , Design , Preparation of metal plates , Printing , Inspection , Packaging and Distribution and Disposal .
process is inspection , where the printed sheets are
If they are not very good , we can destroy them securely . However , a few sheets may be partially damaged . That does n't matter due to the fact that further separation will assist you with getting rid of the wrong sheets .
Remember when in school you learned the three essential things for living ; reproduction , nutrition and interaction ?
Well , humans have become more and more sedentary with the passage of time and have forgotten about interaction and movement .
I might not have the typical sportswoman body type , but I really enjoy doing sport and feeling the glory of movement .
My favourite sport is tennis . Although it is not the only one I practise , it is the one I most like to play .
Apart from obviously having fun and socialising , the way you feel after running and burning feels really good .
Therefore , in the future , I will keep improving those abilities and become a more organized person .
If you want to start practising this sport , you have to get fit and run a lot because you have got to have a good physical condition to play because it is a very demanding sport .
Let me introduce myself . I am Luis from Spain and I work as a civil engineer in a Spanish infrastructure company called Acciona .

It 's one of the most beautiful castles , in my opinion , and it represents the most important thing this country is known for , and that is Dracula .
He was actually one of the rulers of this country and his real name was Vlad Tepes .
And if you want to have some fun too , there are some festivals that you might enjoy .
The biggest one in the country is in the city where I live , so you 'll have a place to stay , and for free .
I hope my advice was useful and I look forward to seeing you next year .
For three years , I babysat my neighbor 's two daughters .
There have been rumors of the construction of a Metro in our town .
The statement given in the rubric proposes an issue of the future of public transport in developed countries .
Modern megalopolises are suffering because of a surplus of automobiles .
At the beginning of the 7th century , Cáceres was conquered by the Arabs .
At the end of the 14th century , Cáceres was conquered by the Romans .
Therefore , it is a multicultural and multiracial society .
The center of the historical city is the Big Square . There are mixed Arabs and Roman buildings , and two cathedrals .
My favourite restaurant is Chinese .
In Caceres we can eat Chinese food at Food House .
I love swimming because if you are angry or your job is very stressful , you will feel well after thirty minutes in a pool .

Since ancient times , public transport has existed , and it suffered numerous assassination attempts . In China , for example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at that time , chariots ) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against the Mongol 's dictatorship on it ; the situation was reversed in an early socialist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars an instrument of oppression and symbol of devilish capitalism .
Convenience has little to do with the fate of public transport . Countries with high HDI ( convenience to be drivers ) , like Germany and England , are those with better public transport systems , and they are even boosting them .

To achieve this , Guido creates an imaginary game for his child once they are deported to a concentration camp .

Now we are going to evaluate the main characteristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
As mentioned above , the heat is necessary to warm up the air that , thanks to the fan , will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient ( e.g. room , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove . The difference is that , instead of a fan , here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it needs a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the purpose of a fan and a pump is the same : move fluid from a point A to a point B , but in one case , you have to move air and in the second case , water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .

I went to the abandoned house and started to think of the best way to make his life miserable . I spent the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him suffer .
As I did n't find anything , I went to the place where he lived and started to look for some information about his life and find people who he cared about . So as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house , s I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl . She might be his girlfriend , so I finally got an idea . I would drive him crazy just as he did me . That way she would think he had problems with his mind and leave him . But soon i thought about it again and realized that if I did that she would try to help him and they will be more united , so I decided to drive them both crazy , almost to the brink of death , just as he did with me !
I screamed . My anger had dominated my mind . I did n't have any control over my actions .

The best revenge .
But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and greater . I had made a decision and I was going to do it . If he dedicated 4 years of his life to torturing me and not wanting me to be happy , the time is necessary for him to have a miserable life and I wo n't stop until I have accomplished my goal .

Technology has changed people 's lives a lot . In fact , we can think how different our life is compared to either our parents ' or our grandparents ' lives . For example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there was n't any TV in the world when they were young . But that is n't the only difference : we can think about the mobile phone , the computer and finally the internet . Our grandparents could n't have imagined a strange machine like the computer in their lives .
So the best way for them to travel is public transport .
Each person should practice saving energy when using any source of energy to protect his own life .

First , I agree with the given statement that there will be a tough time for public transportation in the near future , because people want privacy as well as freedom , which is quite impossible on public transportation .
as much as possible of the city or town which mismanaged routine for people who travel by public transportation . As a consequence , generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I can say that there are various modes of transportation available
which play an important role in giving tough competition to the government . As a result of this , the consumer gets more benefits , like lower fairs , privacy , freedom and safe travelling . In addition , many automobile companies launch new cars at affordable prices , which encourages people to use more and more private vehicles .

With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of populations , a lot of agricultural land , forest and ocean has been used or destroyed to build more buildings and transport networks .
To start with , there are a wide range of problems it may lead to .
Additionally , people now continue to destroy more agricultural land and forest in order to satisfy all their needs , which will destroy the ecosystem , diversity and biodiversity , especially the endangered species .
In light of the problems mentioned above , there are various approaches that governments should adopt to deal with this problem . First of all , reducing building construction from now on , and planting more trees instead .
Sustainable development should be awaness to all human beings and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and its problems should be worked on to resolve them before things get worse , and the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
I took that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity , I said yes .
I want to say something about learning the English language . It is hard for me for the following reasons :
First reason : the grammar that teachers or institutes teach is like the Spanish language , my native language .
I want to say that it is very difficult to understand the conjugation of the verbs in Spanish , so just imagine the same but not in your native language .
Second reason : in English syntax , the rules for constructing paragraphs or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but not always . What is the rule ?

Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on our lives , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants .
Alongside its development , the ability to travel has become easier to such an extent that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as to the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not just a citizen of his own country , but a global citizen .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies completely on tourism .
If tourism influences the economy , it thereby influences the environment , and if it influences the environment , it influences transport . How ? people become more careful at their historical sites , thereby preserving them . Transport is developed both on a small and a large scale .

No future for a public transport ? Is this claim true or not ?
I think that it all depends on the development .
Yes , I agree , if you planned the journey for a faraway destination and for a long time you would prefer to do it by car , because , firstly , you 'll spend less time , your journey will be comfortable , you 'll have the possibility to stop any where and for a long time , as you need to .
But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is the question for everyone , and there ca n't be one answer for all , because one person can use public transport , and save in this way not only money , but the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . because they spend more time travelling or they simply do n't like to travel with other people .

I 'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant . It 's name is " Lemon " . I go there every week . It has different food to other restaurants . I like crispy chicken with garlic sauce . It 's an excellent choice for me . And my favorite appetizer is sausage and in order that dessert I like " Vadge " cake with chocolate sauce . I feel at ease when I go there .

The striking thing for anyone , is that despite all of these advantages , the prices are not expensive .
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am playing with my team , I am in another world in which I can be free and happy . Apart from this , when I am feeling bad , this is a distraction from university .

Regarding advertising , technology is having a huge and not always positive impact on outdoor advertising .

Soccer is a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to control the ball and dribble your rivals on the field .

I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations . I am talented when it comes to entertaining people , which might come in very useful in my role as a summer camp counsellor .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electronics student from Italy , in the north .
Recently , I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
Mar Azul Restaurant , in the north of Mexico City , was the location for the fourth day of Puerquitour .
After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden need to know what happened to her biological mother and why she gave Anna away .
After finding the adoption papers , she contacted the adoption agency .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her biological mother would be a match for a kidney transplant " .
The importance of working hard to achieve goals and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for siblings .
The last step would be to recruit a staff of professional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
Undertaking a scholarship and admission to one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school in a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I acquired at high school .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the commitment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my chosen university in more ways than one .
Despite these two being the most popular sports amongst athletes , many more are just as interesting and beneficial .
For example , things might not go as they had expected for multiple reasons , such as not having enough money or not getting a job .
In addition , we had to have one year of volunteering in a Youth Supervision environment in preparation for our final assignment , so I am able to be a member of your highly - skilled staff .
Since I was 13 years old , I have helped my parents with bringing up my four younger siblings .
I have a friendly , happy personality and find that I enjoy the challenges of working in youth environments .
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when , across the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass."What 's that ? " , Max said aloud .
It 's about a teen couple who are dying of cancer , and they have different ways of thinking about life and death .
This movie touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people usually live without appreciating the really important things .
It is a cyclical process .
Rome had its heyday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later , it was only a shadow of its past .
One day in the future , another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an excuse for some country to declare war on another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have their roots in much older times .
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots in events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots in a past conflict that may well have happened already .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in the 16th century , finally rebuilt in a Renaissance style , which has remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably the famous arcaded courtyard .
During the tour , the visitors are shown several rooms and apartments , as well as the Royal Private Apartments with world - famous tapestries of the Polish kings ' collection .
Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't remember is that it can also be the worst .
This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we discover something new or we say something , they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .
As I said , adolescents can be very confused and if there 's one thing that gets under our skin , it is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite .
That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't let us fall asleep at night .
Travelling by car is also much more convenient .
In conclusion we can say that , from the standpoint of doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underground dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people . The new boxers could be even more at risk .
There are all sorts of proposals ; lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn , or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the later rounds . These would all show off the boxers ' skill and talent and still be entertaining to watch .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be categorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particularly oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
This again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature can not be categorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and any occurrence is for some good .
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challenged .
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully integrated with Europe .
In fact , in political , economic and defence terms , I feel this reallocation of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst , to a certain extent , I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless bureaucrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
This process will continue and Europe and the rest of the world will evolve with or without the participation of Britain in this process .
In relinquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerance .
These superpowers were economically , militarily and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is successful depends very much on the people of Europe .
To remedy this , the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stretches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception .
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic on the part of the road system obviously increases the risk of drivers having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might seem an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the railways .
People are not taking to the rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privatisation of different areas .
Then people would be more likely to catch the train , as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for a bus or pay for an expensive taxi ride .
My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services . This would get people off the roads and onto the trains .
To improve the rail service , trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times , i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six .
The train and bus companies have to liaise with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap , i.e. the same price as or less than it would cost to go by car .
The basic dilemma facing the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .
Most large cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport , thus decreasing major congestion in rush hour periods .
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicular transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere , damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . Torturing the Earth we are living on .
To illustrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stopped for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .
The most likely answer lies in 2 areas . Firstly , the attitude of many westerners is that it is their right to travel in such a manner .
I am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in teepee s and eat soya bean soup . However , I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .
Do we , the western world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at this environmental cost ?
Just because we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earlier to catch public transport .
That could have disastrous implications .
The 2nd reason , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much ; there is no train to catch in the morning .
This has now been intensified with the sale of the railways to private rail companies , profit motivated .
The vital , small rail links may now be closed , whereas previously they where subsidised to make up the loss . Now the private companies can not afford to do this , so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it , and the only people to do this is the government or ourselves . If we make the effort to use public transport , it will expand into a good service . Unfortunately , the public seem to be apathetic towards this idea .
Although it may sound cruel , I do not believe that any fighter has entered a professional boxing career without knowing the risks .
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' sport ' safer : having ringside doctors , banning bare hand fights , but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controversy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again at the forefront of discussion .
The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport , would be leading the protests against boxing .
This hypocritical view is shared by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the foreseeable future .
The lottery has also suffered allegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound received by the lottery goes to charitable causes . The rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so - called charities .
It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , i.e. highly unlikely .
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high . Most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had ruined their life , alienating them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give fourteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .
I would also remove any American business interests and give the charity money to a more deserving ' charity ' .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathematicians and scientists for making numerical calculations .
The world watched in anticipation . We were mesmerized by the images of the TV , expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it . I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you heard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After all this time ! " , " I never thought it would happen .
Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Poland and Rumania rose against communist regimes as well . Now , three years later , communism as we once knew it no longer exists .
The repetition of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and , not only that , it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Whether it be a kitchen knife used to stab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmless as a pillow used to suffocate .
Normally , more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy .
There are people who are against this , saying it is not natural and asking is it fair to the child to have started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .
, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundreds of lives by vaccinating people against measles , for example .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations i.e .
People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants . There are many complications but many are successful .
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the foetus is formed , and the baby is then inserted back into the mother .
The foetus is left to grow and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely beneficial because married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccessful are able to have children .
As the foetus begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSE .
This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consuming the animal .
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point about BSE .
Although British farmers have learned to diversify , dairy farming and the sale of beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalopathy , or BSE .
For beef to be reprieved or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .
This claim has devastated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .
As you can imagine , this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants , where beefburgers are the main item on the menu .
The answer to this question lies in one 's feelings about Democracy .
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstinate opposition .
This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild , disgruntled zealots and was , therefore , detrimental to the good of society .
Like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readily received if the public it was being aimed at was not so jaded .
However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrity ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and difficulties .
Though it has probably been around for a while , it s presence hasn't really been known until fairly recently , and it s consequences have been devastating .
AIDS has definitely had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world , because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana ; from survival kits and basement bomb shelters to an ever - circulating Chief Executive command post from the air .
It was also attempted to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
In part , it has created The Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th century is often labelled .
Presidents and dictators alike switch on the channel to receive first - hand information from the network , such as impeachments , coups d'etat or civil wars .
40% of U.S. millionaires are entertainers .
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversible .
The waters of the culinary seas had been calm and consistent for centuries .
Progress had moved slowly like the tides and the constant rhythm of the waves showed little change .
However , with the dawn of the twentieth century , a storm brewed .
In an age where time is the scarcest commodity , our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzying pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .
Every morning I listen for the weather forecast and dress accordingly .
TV commercials and TV programs project models of how one should be .
People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substituted with TV . In America , this growing individualistic society , one no longer sees the relative humanness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessful , and attribute their inability to achieve to a lack of effort .
There was a group of scholars in France , l'Academie Française , that set guidelines for French literature .
According to l'Academie Française , all literature of the Neoclassical period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Baron who bathed with the Muslim and was punished for his homosexual act .
After the Baron is caught bathing with the Muslim , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
He attracts the hypocrisy of the Church in the old woman 's father being the Pope .
Desegregation reduced some prejudice , but it still exists .
This is based on equity theory .
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar antonyms but indifference .
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through , we can sympathize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victims are necessary to avoid indifference .

The bride and groom simply go toa registryoffice andcomplete the marriage application form , which has the bride 's , the groom 's , and two witness 's signatures .
No picture IDs are required to complete the marriage application form .

We have n't had a lifetime employment system since the late 80 's .
Instead , I 've witnessed powerful harassment like `` You 're incompetent ! `` , or , `` We do n't afford to pay people like you , `` in order to force them into early retirement .
Luckily , I have a job and a dependable income .
And yesterday , I ate dinner , but I ate two hamburgers late at night . .
I have not drank alcohol in a couple days .
