There are so many theories in one academic field . For example , in software engineering , both Java and C + + are very useful programming languages .
In China , C + + is used more frequently than Java ; consequently , teachers should pay more attention to C + + .

In some circumstances , theories in textbooks are no use in real life .
Moreover , it is better studied on campus , in a lab , not in a company ,
As Bertuard Russell said , `` Experience without learning is better than learing without experience . ``
Every professor in a field that offers the opportunity to work outside , should ; the others may stay on campus .

There are two reasons : harming the environment and decreasing a chance of communication .

The second reason is a decrease in opportunities for communication .

How to learn the fundamentals of other languages
The first step in studying language
I struggled to find the way to learn other languages efficiently . ( or effectively ) .
I did n't have enough money to go to a language school ,
After 5 years of looking , I found one of the ways to understand the foundation of other languages .

When we have to use the language ,
the sentences will appear automatically .
To fill up your brain with the sentences ,
This text explains the way of fundamental training .
Of course the method can be applied to other texts containing fundamental sentenses with CD
I 'm looking forward to the day that I can explain the effectiveness of this method for gaining ability in foreign languages .
However , it was not planned and there was evidence .
Spending a foreign festival like Christmas in a `` foreign `` place seems very interesting .
And that means the exams are right around the corner .
Perhaps it is due to our education system - you come to school to study , the school gives you a mark on your paper .

AL Chinese Language and Culture
I really appreciate AL Chinese Language and Culture because it is one of the tests to check our whole life skills in reading , listening , speaking and writing which we always use when we are a university student .
But I am very much disappointed with AL Chinese Langage and Culture in its culture test , testing our ' Chinese culture knowledge ' and ' Chinese culture judgement ' , which I find most hateful .
Carefully , there is a difference between ' Chinese culture knowledge ' and ' Chinese culture judgement ' .
Testing your ' Chinese culture knowledge ' is based on what the famous Sophists say .
But testing your ' Chinese culture judgement ' tests your judgement on using your ' Chinese culture knowledge ' .
This is my first point why I am disappointed with AL Chinese Language and Culture .
Why do I need to use ' Chinese culture knowledge ' to comment on certain kinds of events ?
hate Chinese Culture because I have realized that some of the Sophists ' theories are too ' ideal ' .
Although my teacher said the answers are correct in the right direction , no matter what you think , the answers are still always wrong in two ways .
And two your answers go against what your teacher 's thinking about .
This is the second reason why I am disappointed in AL Chinese Language and Culture because you need to think what most of the people are thinking .

However , the benefits reaped by technology far outweigh its disadvantages .
I am going to Thailand soon . . .

From my perspective , this game 's fantastic point is , using very realistic human avatars for acrobatic movement .
I feel that , the central focus of Mirrors Edge realistic body exsit in the `` body image `` .

Minerals like gold or diamonds that were found there were , along with food , transported to England .

Criticism about Japanese Working Condition
Before they work in Japan as an immigrant or temporary worker , they need to know about how weird Japanese working condition is .
Japanese 3rd year university students generally do jobhunting in order to get a job from autumn .
They register in this site to check up - to - date information about the companies they want to join .
I think it is strongly weird to prepare for jobhunting while they are studying in university .
Starting job hunting from 3rd year is too early for both the students and the universities , I suppose .
We take 1 to2 hour lessons about what the company 's vision is , what kind of people work in the company , what kind of people they need .
They have to struggle to simultaneously do job hunting and write thesis .

Its been a bit over 2 months in Japan since I left England at the beginning of December .
I really like living in Japan coz foods r delicious here , compared to fish n chips , I miss the pub sooo much though .
As soon as I came back 2 Japan , I noticed that high - ball ( whiskey n cider with ice ) was very popular among the young generation .
I was wondering that almost all students drink only beer all the time , even whiskey originated in England ; such as jack daniels , old malt and so on .
It is a strange phenomenon that more Japanese youths consume British whiskey than British adolescents !

We can not afford to let immature students go astray academically , mentally , or physically .
First and formost , in terms of cultivating students ' interpersonal skills , learning via computers or televisions can never manage to reach a comparable level . Unlike learning from a make - believe world , face - to - face interaction and communication is much more real , and in all likelihood , students can effectively equip themselves with the ability to compete and collaborate with their peer counterparts . Thus , ( traditional ) schooling will definitely lay a sound foundation for their later social life .
And I firmly believed that learning using technology will never render school education redundant .
I listened to 3 groups 's songs .

The trembler

At the moment of the tremor , I was downstairs alone in my house , sprawled underneath a Japanese Kotatsu .
As a matter of fact , it was said that a big earthquake would hit in our region , predicted by seismologists .
I did n't think it would cause so many casualties .
Yet the tsunami ruthlessly took many people 's lives .
My house is not too close to the sea , so we are away from the calamity of the tsunami .

But I have heard a sentence .
When I look at that paper and the words on it . `` Today I received Yilin 's $ 10000 and since then I will never threaten her . `` It made me sure that you loved me because when I did something wrong and hurt you , you did n't scold me but helped me instead .
Then I do n't need to expect you to stay with me everyday . I do n't need to wait for your messages and phone calls . You also do n't need to wait for me to graduate from university . You can get married to a woman and have a baby as other people your age do .

I went to the Dhrama fair this afternoon at Kakio in Kawasaki city .

So I decided to listen to a French radio program because they broadcast a program for beginners from April and its level is exactly for me .
I do n't know that clearly .
In my opinion , It 's true .

That 's why most reporters consider a title is more attractive and aggressive before they write articles .
There , I did Zigoku Meguri which is one of the good sightseeing routes in Oita .
I can cook Japanese cuisine , Chinese , and also Korean - style .
But I 'm not really sure about French - style cuisine , since they use a lot of herbs in their meals .
In Japan we typically use herbs occasionally , but not as much as the French do .

I 'd never thought about the difference and that reason for it .
It 's impossible to continue from butterfly to backstroke in the same lane in the team race .
So why do they start with butterfly in the 4x100m individual medley ?
I guess to dive from the starting blocks is faster than starting with backstroke .

The valuable thing is the knowledge you get , and it ca n't be counted by the number at all .

according to the public report , electrical tools are getting more popularity in daily life .
Now most people use electrical lamp instead of candles , digital camera instead of foolproof camera and computer printing instead of hand writing ,
As the years past by , though some electronics have become the most important part of our life , we can not imagine what our life would be if there is no electrical , so people call the new century as digital age .
In the digital age , maybe someone can not realize it clearly , but without the computer , without the TV , without the phone , what would our life be ?
we have gotten used to the convenient life by electrical tool , we use the computer to search for information , because books are to heavy to find a little information , we use the TV to watch all kinds of program , because we can not travel around the world , we use the phone to get touch with friends and parents , because we are far away from them .

Japanese Nationality # 2
Most Japanese are not religious , but their attitudes reflect their culture or nationality .
For example , in Antarctica , which has incredible views of landscapes of ice , the ecosystem has been affected as a result of tourism .
To get there a simple traveler emits 4 . 5 tonnes of CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) , which is an impressive amount of pollution .
Today , tourism is in a crisis as a result of the economic crisis , but we must not forget touristic activities that include the preservation of the environment .
Therefore there are places which include both activities : tourism and environmental care .

Although there are many organizations that evaluate which city is the most livable around the world , one of them says that Vancouver is the most livable city in the world .
The city of Vancouver got first place of the ranking for multiple consecutive years but I do n't think so .

Who the hell is thinking this city is the most livable city ! ?
I think they need to add the sentence `` For rich people `` before `` The most livable city ``
I think these topics are too difficult to be written about by me .
In today 's education - obsessed society , more and more parents encourage / push / force
Because compulsory education negatively affects children
To begin with , living in modern society , foreign language skills have become a necessary subject , In fact , noteworthy international companies are looking for talented people who are good at speaking their respective languages .
It would have a negative effect on them as a whole .
The acquisition of / development of foreign language skills is not the only ideal way for their future .
Children are apt to concentrate on what they are intersted in .
if their aptitudes are discovered , it might provoke positive result widespread .
In conclusion , although the global arena has led to the pressure to master a foreign language skill , in my opinion , however , there are an infinitude of potential in children ; parents should find their ability in all aspects .

Today is August third , when I finished my studying for my cream

From today 's morning , researchers are searching his capsule .
The most beneficial change I can think of would be to the equipment used to connect to the internet , so that both students and teachers could connect to the wireless internet service anywhere in the university .
In addition , if the university had the wireless internet connection service in all areas , students and teachers could access the web whenever they wanted . Such a service would help them to study with the latest information for their research / on the topics of their research .
Therefore , I had to follow the new information every day for my research and I had to go to the computer center to access it online .
With the wireless internet connection , I could make my research in the library , which was much more efficient for doing my work .
If I were a university student or teacher now , I would certainly propose to introduce the wireless internet service in the school , which would have a huge benefit for the students and teachers .
I will use Lang - 8 to improve my English and write daily .

I was born in Xi ' an which is widely known as one of the oldest cities around the world , as many as 13 dynasties chose Xi ' an as the capital city , which makes me proud .
Just several decades ago , rivers were completely available for swimming and fishing .
Now if I am qualified to change one thing here , I would love to change the environment here .
Xi ' an had experienced a really rapid industrial development during last 30 years . People 's material demand have been highly satisfied .
Nowadays , when people do n't have to worry about their livelihood , they unanimously find the environment here is much worse than they have imagined .
We have extremely hot summer , unbearable winter , dusty spring and gloomy autumn .
Currently if we keep doing this , undoubtedly this city will be turned into a place where no longer suitable for people to live , sequentially economic achievements will vanish into the air .
Once I 'm fortunate enough to be qualified to change environment here , shutting inefficient factories , pouring money into improving air and water quality , vigorously encouraging environment conservative companies , cultivating environmental conscience among youngsters will firstly be done .

It 's like when visiting a Japanese restaurant in Europe . The foods there tastes like Japanese food , but there 's always be something that holds me back from calling it ' Japanese food ' .

One of my classmates from college already got married last year . I feel a little surprised because it 's only been two years since graduation and it 's possible that their financial condition is not good enough for raising a family .

After getting married , they might have many problems that before could not have been imagined . Sometimes it will be difficult to get through it , but if two people love each other enough , they will finally solve the problem .

Children are given too much free time ? Task4
Nowadays , some people might concern that children are given too much free time .
From my point of view , when they are given too much free time by school , they may spend more time on surfing the internet , playing computer games or watching TV , moreover , will probably do something which is not allowed under their age without a guardian .
It maybe not a good idea either , it will make studies become boring and tiring , yet the extra presures given were not necessary .
In my opinion about children 's free time , I believe school is a good environment where student start their socail life and team work , including vairety of studying .
However , when they are out of school , they also should arrange their free time wisely to do other recreational activities instead of an axtra school work .

In the University , my favourite place to go is the Library . There are a lot of good books and music ( ? ? ) . The atmosphere is very nice , very quiet . You can read any book you want to . The library is very big and when you want to have a rest you can look out of the window . Everywhere around you can see the trees and hear the birds singing , and feel the wind blow on your face . Fantastic !

Nevertheless I went .
The Internet changes us
The picture depicts a scene where everyone , women and men , young and old , surf online .
They confine themselves in a separate room all day .
I 'm looking foward to going there , but it means I wo n't be able to enter the prefecture tournament .
In a florist 's I saw many beautiful cyclamens .
I heard that they often eat century eggs in Chinese restaurants in the Philippines from my Filipino teacher a little while ago .
Other people probably thought that I was mad , but I like that !
Today I gave an American guy a call through Skype , It is my frist time to use Skype and talk with a Chinesepod student .
I have had lots of students in the last four years , but I teach them face to face , so it 's easy to know what they want to know and want to say .
At the beginning , I was a little bit nervous but we keep the conversation going smoothly !
So I relieved .
Every time when I actually sit down to read some books or do some lesson reviews , it just does n't work .

The tray and spoon , which I bought at Tagakushi in Shinshu , are made of bamboo .
Looking for a Suitable Partner
Yeah , finally , I opened my mouth .
Although they refused me as some of them were not English native speakers or they had already had a partner .
Although the rice was a little tough , it was so delicious .
However , the chief of our speech section said that his performance was too passionate / exaggerated .
He told me that , while Japanese judges tend to demand speakers to deliver thier speech emotionally ( ? ) , foreign judges want speakers to deliver their speech naturally .
The chief said that his speech was too calm .
That really impressed me ,
This thought crossed my mind .
I have to admit though , I do like the taste of meat .
I was really shocked that people can be that cruel .
`` You have two choices , you can wait here until the electric power is restored , or you can finish now .
Three of my friends came to my house to study English together as usual this morning .
The street from Harajuku station of JR yamanotesen to Meiji street is called `` Takeshitadori `` .
It is very fun for me because there are many kinds of cool shops , for example apparels , restaurants , sweets shops , nail shops and so on .
`` Backpacker `` is a name for someone who loves to travel .
So , when I found this site , I was pleased with it , registered right away and tried to write a lot .

She sent a message to me yesterday to make an appointment to study Thai and Chinese for when I travel with my friends in Kaoget .

it is really easy for her to do but not me because I do n't have any experience before . Thank you for reading .

I think we had a small problem ? a long time ago .
especially since I dont ' know what I would say .
You may think it is funny going to a rock festival despite us being so old .
At times like this , to avoid misinterpretation and unnecessary panic , the Venusians consulted their Martian / Venusian Phrase Dictionary .
She then attempts to help him by asking questions or talking about what she thinks the problem is .
I need you to ask me questions to assist me in discovering what is happening . `` At this point she proceeds to anger him by asking questions when he real wants to be left alone .
`` It 's all right `` translated into Venusian means `` This is a problem but you are not to blame .
You can abuse me and I can abuse you `` or she hears `` It 's all right this time , but remember it is your fault .
Without this translation , when he says `` It 's no big deal `` she may hear `` You are making a big deal out of nothing .
Without this translation , when he says `` It 's no problem `` she may hear `` This is not a problem .
Sometimes what he is really saying is the opposite of what she hears .
The best way to show our love , in my opinion , is to strengthen our ability to deal with things and give others a hand if they are in some trouble or need some help .
They also recommend watching movies with English subtitles to understand every sentence !

I have an acute feeling that I have to study English .
I try to study English a little bit .
We were [ very / especially ] excited to watch Shizuka Arakawa win the gold medal in Torino !

During the holidays , I have to finish my school work , essay and other important tasks which still are n't done .
I 've got ta tell you something that 's been on my mind .

I think I would be at ease with written Japanese composition , but at a loss in English .
My abdomen and left elbow hurt .
He had nothing to grab onto and could hardly stand , but the middle - aged man on the priority seat just kept sitting .
That middle - aged man looked at the old man and looked at me again . I thought his conscience was starting to bother him .
I must work and perform my experiment tomorrow morning .
However , I could not agree less . Based on the view that other training institutions ( such as vocational colleges ) are better suited to teach practical techniques , forcing universities to teach vocational courses would violate our freedom to choose our career path .
Because universities are not the only places that can provide employment preparation courses , but are the only places providing academic education .
Apparently , no other institution can replace universities ' ability to cultivate people in a particular academic field , and that is the main reason why people pay their tuition fees .
Moreover , universities are not the best place for practical skilled trainings . There are thousands of institutions and employers who can provide the more up - to - date training that the workforce needs to perform their jobs .
In sum , in comparison with universities , employers and other institutions are better - equipped and better - qualified to prepare people for the employment market .
The graphic of that was drawn by the famous Japanese designer who did the animation for `` Evangelion `` .
It 's Blues , which Clapton is always in , meets hip - hop rhythm style which is really comfortable enough for me to listen to it for about 10 years .

Yesterday , I bought a new digital single - lens camera .
This week I have a 6 - days trip and want to take pictures at night with better focus .
Hearing the explanations , I thought I understood ,
I 'm not good at mechanical machines , so I concluded that it is very difficult to use new camera at this trip .
I hope someone corrects these sentences .
The first I heard about it was from an acquaintance in the US , who claimed to suffer from hearing loss .
( Consequently his senior and I did n't work out .

To begin with , I wrote my introductory .
I like to watch dramas , especially Japanese dramas and Korean dramas .
This is the first time that I wrote a diary in English !
The face I saw was one of my friends who I had n't seen for a couple of years .
But it was great time to make new friends and I leaned some good expressions from the teacher .
I am studying for my exams at the university 's cluster room , but I am freezing as the air conditioner is turned up very high .

What 's a Smoke Test ?
When the bell rung , I thought I would be caught in the rain in on the way to back to my dormitory .
Soon , my hair and clothes have been soaked and I feel cold .
In there , I feel amused by my appearance , so once again I rush in the rain .
[ Replace with lower sentence ] and , I find an umbrella above my head .
A charming smile appears and says ' are you ok ? ' .
On the way to the dormitory , she talks with me in a gentle way , and walks me into my dormitory , although she does n't live there .
So many couples will choose MDH to celebrate their weddings .
I came back from the battle field . I am still alive .
I saw many black passports there , because recently the Japanese government has changed the design of Japanese passports from red to black .
I hope they will go back to Japan ASAP , and work for the Japanese government and be rich Japanese forever .
So when time was almost over , I had only finished around 85 % , so I had to randomly answer the rest of questions .

Reading speed .
My sock doll is not finished .

Each candidate comes out with his own political manifesto to make the country better . However , depending on who is elected , everything will go on to be different from the way it is now , which will be enough to affect other countries all over the world .
Anyway , it is absolute that last night was an important day , so I thought that essentially everyone else was interested in the election .
Well , it is partially true but in fact , not everyone did take notice of it .
Tomorrow I have a Chemistry test 0 . o I studied hard but I think I 'll fail .
The children are the happiest .
They have long holiday and get more pocket money , new clothes and presents from their parents or relatives .
We Chinese have an old tradition .
So the traffic is now very difficult .
It is the internet that has had the most powerful influence on me for the prevalence of computers in my life .
until the new news hit me .
I think I am not going anywhere so I 'll clean my room and I 'll make / cook something that I want to eat when I get hungry .
I 'm in the Travel Tourism Course .
I do n't work at a part time job , but I do want to work at JR Toukai in the future .
The toughest part of my school work is overseas geography .
New digital camera
Today , I 'd like to write about a new digital camera .
What do you think of trends in new digital cameras ?
So I wondered :
In Japan , we eat ' ozoni ' , which means mixed ingredients in soup , as a traditional custom during the New Year week .
^ ^ ; The New Year is supposed to be a holiday , but it 's not a holiday for me .
For that , I should study grammar , words and phrases .
all of the world know that the chinese school uniform is too ugly .
For the last statistics of these votes , the winner will have the most votes for the type of school uniform .
The reason we went to wrong place was the pronunciation of the place we wanted to go to and the place we went to were the same if you pronounce it in Japanese .
We Japanese people are basically covered by health insurance ,
Recently , we have been running up a big medical bill in Japan ,
into practice to reduce medical expense .
This counselling is not compulsory .
In China students learn English from middle school to college , but , there are not many students who can learn English well . First our mindset is wrong . Some of them think that learnning English is a burden . To pass the exam is their only purpose .
Second , the big circumstance is so bad . It is very difficult for you to find people to communicate with you in English . Someone may think if one person got a high mark , his or herEnglish is very good . I do not think so . We all know that language is a tool that we can use to communicate with others .
The rapidity of memorization is fastening .
I went shopping at 10 : 00 this morning ,
Fortunately , South korea has developed accommodations called Jjim - jil - bang .
But today , goods for the Japanese New Year were on display .
Recently , I often thought that I would want to study English again .
I went to an English - speaking country and was been there for 7 years .
When I was overseas , I did n't watch English news channels or movies , I could not understand the popular programs , as I have no idea about their culture background .
I want to listen to , speak , write , and read English better than I do now .
I 'm required to learn formal words rather than informal .
In my case , I 'm exposed to formal situations most often .
During class or school , I would hardly have a chance to use slang .
But I am not a caterpillar , so I give up .
Since the bowl has become empty , finally you can eat an ordinary meal .
I never say `` Do n't worry . its going to be alright `` to make them relax because I am a teacher .
Can you have a recommend a drama ?
The night safari and taxi companies are friends or couples .
I am a brave man , but when we took a tram there , I sat beside a fat American couple because they possibly can not run faster than me .
Probably they ca n't jump over it .
If they do so , does the safari pay a compensation to us ?
So we had to take a taxi , and it was already over 00 : 00 a . m . .
The taxi fare cost DOUBLE .
I think that the night safari and all taxi companies are friends or couples .
I applied for an open position at my company .
There is a botanical garden there famous for wisterias .
However , the wisterias are not in full bloom . I enjoyed tbeautifull flowers and pleasant smells .

What should I do ?
Firstly , since my previous laptop wore out within a very short period of time , I am looking to buy a laptop which is more durable and has a guarantee for at least two years .
First , I 'd like to introduce myself .
It was based onthe true story of someone 's life , and we changed some part of the story .
I noticed there were some problems with my leg
Nobody could explain why it happened .
And so I guess some birds made a noise or hiccuped and dropped them .
I decided not to doubt it .
I miss you like as a friend who cooks with me , watches some movie and cries , smokes a cigarette and talks , talks about life or silly things .
The last time I saw you I could n't hide that I wanted to cry because my confidence has gone .
I hope air heaters will become unnecessary .
but statistics is very difficult .
I am studying English at a university class now .
Yesterday was the summer solstice .
Though it 's after midnight now , 3 : 30am , maximum temperature is 30 degrees celsius .

Today ( yesterday actually ) I met friends and made plans to travel this week .
But I 'm looking forward to do it .
By the way I want to know the difference between personal and private .

The fresh idea is going into a huge refrigerator that is for tons of chickens , saying farewell to the world for a while .
Because a cup of beer I had was $ 13 dollars ! ! ! ! ! !
The problem is my listening for English ! ! !
I 'm going to meet Crysti , my language exchange partner , at Ginza after work .
So , could you help my studying English ?
`` Kaiten - zushi `` restaurants have rotating sushi on a conveyor belt , and you can help yourself to anything on the conveyor belt .
Maybe that is because she is working now , and I am still a poor student , but it does not mean that I do n't want to spend any money on her or other people .
I know vendors do n't wash vegetables so the food is not very hygenic , and they are so expensive , but the festive mood always make me want to buy !
`` I will go to Australia `` , one girl said .

Yesterday I learned that there are UNIQLO shops in the Philippines .
I did n't think that UNIQLO shops would be in the Philippines .

In my opinion , there are many changes in America 's way of thinking .
They want to change and achieve their hopes by voting for Obama .

Doll Festival
The Doll Festival !
Almost all of the house which have girls has ' japanese dolls ' .
We display dolls on Mar . 3rd ( Many houses display from Feburuary I think ) .
I prefer living in a dormitory rather than living off campus .
Living in a dormitory gives us many opportunities to make a lot of friends .
Secondly , living in a dormitory is much more convenient than living off campus .
Most dormitories are located very close to classrooms .
Finally , I will spend less money if I lived on campus .
As a dormitory resident , I will not have to pay for gas , electricity , or water , like an apartment resident does .
In addition , I will not have to pay for furniture such as desks or beds .
I will not need a car either , so I will not be concerned about insurance , gas or parking . Consequently , the dorm is the more economical choice for me and my parents who are paying for my education .

`` Reborn `` , `` Hetalia `` , and `` Detective Conan `` .
Also , childrens ' crimes are not because of comics .
I 'm studying English , so I can go to university .
Talking about the schedule , I checked the schedule and realised I reached work far earlier than I thought .
That was why we swore not to use Japanese during our time here .

In the film , President Mubarak does n't know anything about the conditions of the people .

It wants us to believe that the president does n't know about the problems and obstacles that Egyptians encounter .
This cook blows the whistle on the corruption in Egypt and tell the president exactly what happens in the country .

Three months ago my uncle died . Many people bought lottery tickets using the numbers of my uncle 's birthday and they won the lottery .
Recently I went to my friend 's funeral . Before she was cremated we saw that her numbers were 14 , 41 ( we saw from the box that her body was in before they cremated her ) . Lots of my friends decided to buy lottery tickets but I did not because I believed that maybe I would n't have luck .
This morning my friend asked me if I bought lottery tickets or not . She said she won the lottery today and 3 of my other friends won the lottery too . They are going to get merit for my deceased friend to say thank you .

Although it seems a kind of poison , it must be a medicine ; it is alcohol .
