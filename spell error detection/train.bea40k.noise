There are so many theories in one academic field . For example , in sofrware engineering , both Java and C + + are very useful programming languages .
In China , C + + is used more frequently than Java ; consequently , theachers should pay more attention to C + + .
Students who learn more useful technology will have a big adventage in finding a job .
In some circumstances , theories in textbooks are no ues in real life .
Moreover , it is better studied on campass , in a lab , not in a company ,
As Bertuard Russell said , `` Experice without learning is better than learing without experience . ``
Every professor in a field that offers the opportunity to work outside , should ; the others may stay on campass .
For students ' futures , universities should find more oppprtunities to give their professors .

There are two reasons : worsing the environment and decreasing a chance of communication .

How to learn the fandament of other languages
The first step in studying Langage
I strugled to find the way to learn other languages efficiently . ( or effectively ) .
I did n't have enough money to go to a langage school ,
After 5 years of looking , I found one of the ways to understand the faoundation of otther langages .

the sentenses will appear automatically .
To fill up your brain with the sentenses ,
This text exprain the way of fandamental training .
Of cours the method can be applied to other texts containing fandamental sentenses with CD

I have been looking for an interesting American drama that can help me improve my English listening skills , and today I finally found ' The Mentalist ' on an Internet site and downloaded 5 edisodes from the first season .
This drama is about investigators who belong to the California Victims Inverstigation organization and try to find murdurers .
It is very fascinating because the mantalist uses his mental power and hypnosis to track down the murduer .

I Have Qustions Again .
Well , I 'm reading at the momment a book called ( I do n't know the correct translation in English , I 'm translating the Portuguese title ) The girl that steal books . . .
I 'm in the beginig , I ca n't undestand the story so well . Since a lot of people told me it 's a wonderful book , I 'm excited to read it . . .
Usually it is played by professional SUMO wrestrers , but on this show , it is played by other fighting sports players and TV talents .
The unique concept of it , and the amazing sence and talent of some players excited me so much !
Lo and behold , the Strikeforce chanpion as well as the DREAM chanpion Alistair Overeem was there , and he won !

with the differences , we ca n't learn the foreige cultures completely , and then if we do not have a good knowledge of the different cultures , it is a big challenge for us to write an English essay well .
As foreige language learners , we seldom communicate with others in English or write English letters to others in our daily life ; that is to say , we do not have a good environment to learn and we regard the writing course as what we have to learn , but what we want to learn well .
And I believe that if we learn more foreige culture and develop a better language environment in our English study , we will find that it will be easier for us to write .
Somehow , I recently have n't takjed with Americans in English .
A few days ago , we went to the cinema to see `` Shrec forever `` near my home .

It may be tempting to argue theia easy life may carry potential drawbacks .
However , the denifits reated by technology far outweight the disadvantages .

Firstly , I think there are three ways to understand the meaning of words of second languages - replacement , internal difinition , and external difinition .
Internal difinition means learning words by dictionary difinition .
External difinition means learning words by guessing its meaning when they are used in particular situations .
Our experience has taught us that it is difficult to learn words with only their dictionary difinition .
By learning second languages , you can enjoy tranveling abroad .
First , the only way for Japanese people to understand English is to learn by external difinition because of ( due to ) large cultural differences .
So we have to learn English by external difinition .
By doing so , we can understand the exact meaning that we ca n't if we interprete English into Japanese .
We have to stop the traditional way of learning English : interrpretation .

AL Chinese Langage and Culture
I really appreciate AL Chinese Langage and Culture because it is one of the tests to check our whole life skills in reading , listening , speaking and writing which we always use when we are a university student .
But I am very much disappionted with AL Chinese Langage and Culture in its culture test , testing our ' Chinese culture knownledgement ' and ' Chinese culture judgement ' , which I find most hateful .
Carefully , there is a difference between ' Chinese culture knownledgement ' and ' Chinese culture judgement ' .
Testing your ' Chinese culture knownledgement ' is based on what the famous Sophists say .
But testing your ' Chinese culture judgement ' tests your judgement on using your ' Chinese culture knownledgement ' .
This is my first point why I am disappointed with AL Chinese Langage and Culture .
Why do I need to use ' Chinese culture knownledgement ' to comment on certain kinds of events ?
hate Chinese Culture becuase I have relized that some of the Sophists ' theories are too ' ideal ' .
Although my teacher said the answers are correct in the right direction , no matter what you think , the answers are still always worng in two ways .
And two your answers go agisant what your teacher 's thinking about .
This is the second reason why I am disappointed in AL Chinese Langage and Culture becuse you need to think what most of the poeple are thinking .

I feel that , the central focus of Mirros Edge realistic body exsit in the `` body image `` .
Mirror 's Edge `` realistic body `` does not depend only on the grahical detail .
Avator 's breath and the crashing sound is very real .

Secondary avator ( NPC ? ) action is not realistic , but the action variation is based on generall human action .
Most of avator 's actions are possible for generall human .

People there are very poor . They do n't have enought food and water , and this is , in my opinion , caused by the colony politic . Especially England 's colony politic .

Minerals like gold or diamonds that were found there were , along with food , transported to England .

Critisism about Japanese Working Condition
Before they work in Japan as an immigrant or temporaliy worker , they need to know about how wierd Japanese working condition is .
Japanese 3rd year Universtiy students generally do jobhunting in order to get a job from autumn .
They register in this site to check up - to - date information about the companeis they want to join .
I think it is strongly wierd to prepare for jobhunting while they are studying in university .
Starting job hunting from 3rd year is too early for both the stundent and the universities , I suppose .
We take 1 to2 hour lessons about what the company 's vision is , what kind of people work in the company , what kind of people thet need .
They have to struggle to simultanously do job huntig and write thesis .

I heard that Japanese productivity per person is lowest among advanced contries .
How hard they work is hard to evaluate under the Japanse working system .
If the evaluation systme goes well in Japan , nobady stays late .

We can not afford to let immatrre students go astray academicly , mentally , or physically .
First and formost , in terms of cultivating students ' interpersonal skills , learning via computers or televisions can never manage to reach a comparable level . Unlike learning from a make - believe world , face - to - face interaction and communication is much more real , and in all likelyhood , students can effectively equip themselves with the ability to compete and collaborate with their peer counterparts . Thus , ( traditional ) schooling will definitely lay a sound foundation for their later social life .
And I firmly believed that learning using technology will never render scoool education redundant .

Time flies away . Half of my vacation has gone by . I travelled and spent a lot of time with my family and freinds . . . Now I have just one month to relax and do something I realy want to do .
Therefore , I am trying to decide how to spend the rest of my vacation . Should I do an intership or just stay at home and learn someting ?

As a hushand , you have to maintain ur family and keep a harmony relationship with you and your partner 's relatives .
so that they can understand ur ability and respect you .

So salay plays an important role when we seeking partners .

Music , film , and all kinds of programms provide people with a better living environment .
They are related to eath other .
In conclusion , it is hard to compare the contributions of art and science . It is simplt subjective to say that one contributes more to society than the other .

The most beneficial change I can think of would be to the equipements used to connect to the internet , so that both students and teachers could connect to the wireless internet service anywhere in the university .
In addition , if the university had the wireless internet conneciton service in all areas , students and teachers could access the web whenever they wanted . Such a service would help them to study with the latest information for their research / on the topics of their reserch .
Therefore , I had to follow the new informaiton every day for my reserch and I had to go to the computer center to access it online .
With the wireless internet connection , I could make my reserch in the library , wich was much more efficient for doing my work .
If I were a university student or teacher now , I would certainly propose to introduce the wireless internet service in the school , wich would have a huge benefit for the students and teachers .

So I hope that the Japanese govenment will decide to lower the level under 1mSv at once .

The Japaneese language entirely depends on context and situation , and it is less clealy than Europian languages .
However , Japanese people should not change their language into something like a Europian language , which states everything clearly , because it is part of the Japanese culture .

Hence , students completely depend on tutorials and unfortantely they forget about their lectures due to focusing only on the classroom tutorial .
First of all , tutorials are cosidered a awaste of time and money .
Having mentioned the disadvatages of tutorials , I should also mention the advantages .
First of all , tutorials cancel the distance between the teachers and the students and as a result of that students can ask freely with out being afraid . From my point of view , this is a very important thing for every studentThey . They also stress information that students need .
To sum up , if we make a list of what is written befor , we will see that the disadvantages of these tutorials outweigh the advantages . So students should attend their classes regularly and follow their teacher 's instructions instead of tutorials which waste time and money .

One of my classmates from college already got married last year . I feel a little surprised becase it 's only been two years since graduation and it 's possible that their finacial condition is not good enough for raising a family .
But maybe my thinking is wrong . Each couple that decides to marry has probably already thought it through to have finaly made such a hard decision . After getting married , they might have many problems that before could not have been imagined . Sometimes it will be difficult to get through it , but if two people love each other enough , they will finally solve the problem .
But everytime time this thought comes to my mind , I realize I would do just the same thing as them .

while reading , if you encouner an unknown word , you guess the meaning and read ahead .
Even if you do n't fully understand it , it does n't matter becasue you will see the word somewhere else in a different context .
With this way , you have to look up in the dicitionary every time you encounter an unknown word .
They ca n't read anything without a dictionary because they are begginers .
last but not least , you should carefully pick what to read for your vocabulry buliding .

Children are givin too much free time ? Task4
Nowadays , some people might concern that children are givin too much free time .
From my point of view , when they are givin too much free time by school , they may spend more time on surfing the internet , playing computer games or watching TV , moreover , will probably do something which is not allowed under their age without a guardian .
It maybe not a good idea either , it will make studies become boring and tiring , yet the extra presures givin were not necessary .
In my opinion about children 's free time , I beleive school is a good environment where student start their socail life and team work , including vairety of studying .
However , when they are out of school , they also should arrage their free time wisely to do other recreational activities instead of an axtra school work .

Japan is just a follower and dog of wenstern countires , we do n't celebrate Chinese New Year at all .

She then attempts to help him by asking qustions or talking about what she thinks the problem is .
I need you to ask me questions to assist me in discovering what is happening . `` At this point she prceeds to anger him by asking questions when he real wants to be left alone .
`` It 's all right `` translated into Venusian means `` Thsi is a problem but you are not to blame .
You can abuse me and I can abuse you `` or she hears `` It 's all right this time , bt remember it is your fault .
Without this translation , when he says `` It 's no big deal `` she may hear `` You are making a big deal out of nothig .
Without this translation , when he says `` It 's no problem `` she may hear `` Thsi is not a problem .
Sometimes what he is relly saying is the opposite of what she hears .
The best way to show our love , in my opinion , is to strengthen our abilityof to deal with things and give others a hand if they are in some troubl or need some help .
They also recommend watching movies with English subtitles to understand eery sentence !

I must work and perfome my experiment tomorrow morning .
However , I could not agree less . Based on the view that other training institutions ( such as vocational colleges ) are better suited to teach practical tachniques , forcing universities to teach educaiton courses would violate our freedom to choose our career path .
Because universities are not the only places that can provide employment preparation courses , but are the only places providing acedemic educaion .
Apparently , no other institution can replace universities ' ability to cultivate people in a particular acedemic field , and that is the main reason why people pay theie tuition fees .
Moreover , universities are not the best place for practical skilld trainings . There are thousands of insititutions and employers who can provide the more up - to - date training that the workforce needs to perform their jobs .
In sum , in comparison with universities , employers and other institutions are better - equipted and better - quanlified to prepare people for the employment market .
The graphic of that was drawn by the famous Japanese desighner who did the animation for `` Evangelion `` .
It 's Blues , which Clapton is always in , meets hip - hop rythem style which is really comfortable enough for me to listen to it for about 10 years .

I think my English will become better and better . One day just like some other people whose English is not very good at first , but later after all the hard work they successed . I used to pratice my oral English because I think English is a tool to communicate with others . If you ca n't speak English smoothly , how can you communicate effectively ?
When I watch other people speak English to foreigners I really admir them . My dream is to talk with foreigners in English one day , so I hope there are some people who would like to talk with me and help me improve my English .

My question is , if you can tell what will happen in 30 minutes , or if you can read what people are thinking , then what whould you like to do ?
My ansewer is perhaps not appropriate for the quastion .
I only want a little bit of these abilities because if I can predict everything in the world and others do the same , the place we are living will become so boring and our eagerness for learning will desappear .

Although it seems a kind of poison , it must be a midicine ; it is alcohol .
Some people belive drinking alcohol is not good for their health .
According to a health resarch istitute , drinking has a positive effect on health .
While one drinks alcohol , they should be able to express inner thoughts that are usually not exprss .
However , people can get these kind of negative effects only when they exceed a moderate amout of alcohol .
When focusing only on the health effects of alcohol , there are no bad effects if one does not esceed their limit to accept alcohol
Consequently , expanding boold vessle and eliminating depression , which are healthy effects , can be brought about by dirinking alcohol .

In addition , students and their parents complain of the incompetent teachers who do not strive to show any effort to imprive their teaching skills .

In conclusion , I agree with the implementation to reform teacher 's regular assessment becasue it has more advantages than disadvantages , such as the improvement of a teacher 's teaching skills and the recovery of students and their parents ' attitude about public educaion .
