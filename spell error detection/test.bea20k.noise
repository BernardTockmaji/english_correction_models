I WANT TO THAK YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US ON THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH .
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT , IN SOME CASS , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
Also , I want to say that the plays and films were exellent , but there were n't enough of them for me .
In our Acadamy we are not allowed to smoke .
I was trully dissapointed by it .
Secondly , I had to wait fourty - five minutes before the show finally began .
I 'd like you to send the money to this adress : ul Taklowa 10
It is a dream becames true and was really unexpected for me !
If not , what do you sugest ?
The festival was excenent in many ways , and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging , but brilliant idea .
MY NAME is JAMES CAMIREZ AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS REGARDING THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY STATES THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30 , AND I GOT REALLY MAD WHEN I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND NOTICED THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 ( FORTY ) MINUTES AND THE SHOW HADN'T STARTED YET ... I MEAN IT WAS AMAIZING !
I COULDN'T BELIVE IT . HOW CAN THIS CLASS OF THEATRE BE SO ..
OH I'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ONE LAST THING , IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER HAD SO I DEMEND MY MONEY BACK !
MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ME IN SEVERAL WAYS . I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ; THE MORE CONFORTNESSCOMFORTABLE WE GET .
BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PACIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE .
THIS CAN BE BAD TOO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BEING CONFORTABLE , WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORK I WON'T BE ABLE TO .
Everybody attented go to the show , funny , and happ in the end , and what have we go then ?
Disapponted !
If you could not manage the programe , why did n't you informe people before the programe started ?
I tought you inderstood ' ; please send money back to me , you know why , do n't answer me ?
Now we know , our world has developed to new world , becase we have high technology to do .
Today , teachnology is a part of life .
It started from got up in the morning , we have the machine help us to cook , iron , cleanning , washing , and then we went out to work , there are car , sky train to travel for help us convenience and quickly .
We appreciated the mordern technology changed my daily life for help every easy and quickly , we have time to do many things .
It is a good start to go on a sightseeing bus on Monday morning , because we can se all the famous buildings in a few hours .
On Wednesday after we have viseted the National Art Gallery , we can have a chat about our next holiday during the free time in the afternoon .
Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and on television is the private lives of famous people .
On the whole , being rich and famous does n't always bring happeness , whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous .
Last week we had another demostration of this .
Firstly , it will introduce the latest fashions connecting Millenium .
Whenever I recollet it , I feel self - confident .
Firstly , I would like to say that I 'm very glad to have been choosen and I will do my best for this competition .
As you mentioned about the accomodation , I would prefer to stay in a tent , because it 's more exciting and I really love camping .
However , I would choose sailing because I am facinating with the sea and its misteries and I also like the watter , the wind in my face ...
The other one I would choose is basketball becouse I 'm tall and very fast with the ball .
It was unbelivebly ! ! !
Are you studing a lot ?
I have just received your letter which made me so hapy . I can not belive that I won first prize in your competition , because I have always believed I am an unluky man and now I think some things are changing in my life .
I would definitly choose basketball and swimming wich are my dream sports .
I would like to ask a few things , specialy about the wheather : what is the weather like in July in the U.S.A ? What kind of clothes will I need and how much money should I take with me ? Because I have never been to the U.S.A. before I do n't know anything about it .
I have never enjoyed doing shopping , but nowday there are some people who are called shopcholic .
They are just like alcholics and these people go shopping every day because they can not stop themselves unless they have not got money to spend .
Because nowdays whereever you go there is a big queue and I hate waiting .
The queues are not the only problem . If you go by car there is the problem of parking , if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during your journey and you wo n't always be luky enough to find a seat .
Specialy if you want to buy clothes with your girlfriend or if you are a girl , you have to be ready to spend hours trying on clothes .
I realy hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they go into a shop they want to try on every single item of clothing and they do not realise the time .
Some people say " shopping is not always enjoyable " but for me it is definity unenjoyable and I think it will be the same for the rest of my life .
First of all , when I bought the ticets it appeared that there was no discount available .
It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was stearing at us .
Firstly when I went to the show it was written that the start time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight . I had waitted for forty - five minutes .
I just knew I should n't have trusted her but as I went in the house my dad asked Pat to stay for a meal . I was in schock , thinking why is n't anyone getting angry with me ? After a while we sat down for dinner and Pat just told my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry .
As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland , we apreciate spending a week in London every year .
First , we could n't get a discount , although you mention it in your advertisment .
I walked back , hoping I would n't come accross anyone and be able to drive back home .
Firstly , could you invite stars and artists from more than only six contries ?
In my opinion , it might be better to have time with a variety of nationallites .
As they know about your interestings and personality , it is easy to help you .
I would like to make some appoitments about the event that I went to .
- Art exbitions to teach us more things about the artist 's lifestyle ; and
Well , about rules in my contry , the situation is not different from other countries .
The rules must be respected by all people if you do n't want to be kicked out of scholl .
However , some of them have read an advertisment about the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March .
Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed : in fact , money and celebrity do n't always bring happiness .
In addition , addmission for students is free .
Yours sincerily ,
On the other hand , the bond between parents and children is unlikly to change .
The smokers in the school yard , the buffett and the other pupils , who are sitting at their tables doing their homework .
That 's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to avoid boredome . I am sure that eventually we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free . There wo n't be any problem with being up - do - date .
Of course , you ca n't afford a luxualy car and a large apartment unless you 're born with a silver spoon in your mouth .
It 's also a really popular job among university students because of the good salaly .
I was really suprised when I opened it .
I look forword to going to the Camp California in the USA .
Because it remainds me of my childhood . I used to go with my friends to a camp , wich was situeded by the seaside .
Nowdays we have many big shopping centers .
The most suitable time for shopping is the weekand when parents do n't work and children haven't got school .
Because of that , shopping centers are overcrowded .
You ca n't buy something in a peacful and calm athmospher .
However such centers are very useful and necessary .
In my opinion the worst thing which may happen is an extremly long queu for the changing room .
If you bought something goregous , you will be very happy .
Yours sincerelly
I 'm writing to you because of the musical show " Over the rainbow " , wich I saw on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre .
There are several points I have to complain about wich meant the evening was not nice at all .
Instead of half past seven the show startet at quarter past eight . I could n't go to get any refreshment for two reasons , the first one is that there was no information about how long the start of the show was going to be late by .
On your tickets information is written that discounts are available , when I asked at the ticket office I could n't get any discount for beeng a student .
After one hour the hohle class had heard about Sarah 's secret .
Everybody was interested in what she had won but knowbody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told as a secret to them .
Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class , when she turned around talking and wispering started .
Sarah looked at him for a while , then she stood in front of the class and explaind to the others that she had won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the coast of southern France and every one of the 19 pupils was invited , except Pat who was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I read your advertissement five days before , and I was realy impressed by it .
But , the quality of this show was n't what you led me to believe it would be , and I feel realy disappointed by it .
For all these reasons , and if you want to keep me as a customer , I would be gratfull if you gave me some or all of my money back .
My marks were n't good enought to obtain my degree in Computer Science , and the exam session was finished .
I never talked about this project to anyone , exept my best friend Pat .
It is a great opportunity because this show is only every two years and normaly it is difficult to go in .
Or going to the show on wensday morning and in the afternoon , we can choose between free time or the National Art Gallery .
I look farward to hearing from you .
They found hime two months later and six months later he was in jail .
I am writing this letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show " over the rainbow " , wich is misleading in a number of ways .
Sweating and affraid I waited outside the director 's office the following day .
Tairs ran down my face as I admitted having stolen .
I was suprised that my father did n't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me .
That evening my father said a few words : ' May this be the end of your career as a thief ; we are only ready to forgive if you promiss never to start again '
I am writing to reply to your letter in which you told me I won first prize in your competetion , which is two weeks . I was very happy with this result since I did not think I could win .
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities in our daily life at school shoud be filmed to give the other students an idea of what we usually do , not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time .
The porpouse of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical " Over the Rainbow " , wich really disapointed me .
First of all , there were no diccounts avaible such as were promised in the advertisement so I had to pay the original price wich was n't cheap at all .
Then , I was forced to wait forty - five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 instead of 19:30 and , when it finally started , I was really disapointed to see that the actors were n't Danny and Tina as it had said in the advertisement .
Your really dissatisfied costomer
How has modern technology afected my daily life ?
We live sorrounded by inventions wich help as through the day .
The reason for my decision is that other activities are also available in my country , except climbing , but I have a fear of heights so this one is not destinated for people like me .
Acctually , they put me very close to the stage , in the middle of the real hell .
This is the main reasone why I want to ask for a refund .
People wo n't be embarassed to show the beauty of their bodies .
Moroever , I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine .
During my stay at Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practise this activitie regularly and I often enter competitions : this is one of my hobbies .
Then , there was only one hour left to install the different color lights ; it was just enought time .
We would suggest going to this fabolous show .
Yours Sincererly ,
Despite being used in many ways , it could entartian us as well .
Although I imagine them in my house in my future , I am sure I would be suprised if I had them .
A usefull helper : the personal computer can quickly help you in lots of situations .
Although the world of computers will develop day by day , I lively hope we ( human beings ) can mantain our way of seeing things .
I'M VERY PROUD TO BE THE WINNER OF YOUR COMPETITION ! I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SUCH A CAMP BEFORE AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWART TO SPENDING TWO WEEKS THERE .
IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR ME TO TRAVEL IN JULY BECAUSE OF MY UNREGULAR WORK .
HE 'S A SMAL ONE !
I'M LOOKING FORWART TO HEARING FROM YOU
YOU KNOW THAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO HELP AT A CONCERT . TO BE PART OF THE STAFF WOULD BE WONDERFUL , I THOUGTH . AND I WAS RIGHT !
AS YOU KNOW I WROTE TO THAT ORGANISATION WHICH IS ALWAYS RESPONSBLE FOR BIG EVENTS .
ALL OF THE STAFF AND THE ORGANISATION SPOK ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW TO SAVE PEOPLE .
WE WERE A GROUPE ! ONE TEAM ! BEFORE THE CONCERT WE HAD A BREAK TO EAT SOMETHING AND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER .
THE CONCERT WAS VERRY LOUD AND LONG BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK HARD .
GREATING AND HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON
However , it was a very dissappointing evening for me .
Firstly , it was mentioned that there were going to be two starrings but , in fact , only one actor was performing in the show .
Thirdly , the advertisment said that discounts were avaliable but the ticket seller said that there was no discount allowing or avaliable .
In addition , the advertisment mentioned that the restaurant would be open after the show but it was closed because short of cooker .
Finally , I would like to ask for my money back on the ticket due to the disapointing evening out and the misleading advertisement you have created .
Nowadays , modern technology is becomming absolutely essential to our daily life .
Without all this your life would definately change back to the same position as it were 50 or more years ago .
If this continues to happen our life will be very misarable as accidents happen all the time .
Thank you very much for the many interesting positions in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are shure , will be very exciting .
I would like to inform you that we have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Laisure Show " and we have found it very interesting .
Suddenly I heard a noice from my garden and I wanted to know what it was , but it was impossible to do it .
I was affraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get into my house .
I was very frethend , but I knew that I had to do something .
I was shure there was someone on the other side of the wall .
The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit to your theatre where I wanted to see the musical ' over the rainbow ' , after I read the advertisement for the show .
The things that really dissapointed me were that you said Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were the actors but they were n't , different actors played and to be honest they made the whole show very bad .
To be honest that was not a great expierence and I hope you will see my point .
Since everyone can afford modern technology everyone 's life in the more developed countries has changed completly .
So in the last century our daily life has changed dramandesly and we have become lazy and our life unpersonal , fast and unromantic .
Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another , unkown actor who starred instead of him .
All those innacuracies spoilt what should have been a memoriable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket .
He did it some more times , and in the end nobody took any notice of the shoutings .
You are working with your ideal woman , I still ca n't belive that I spoke with her .
At first I could n't belive that I was a winer
My school starsts in September and it finishes in June .
If I could go in July that would be greate .
I would like to ask you , what sort of clothes should I take with me ? I do n't want to take too much ; jeans , jumper , swimming costium , T - shirt , sports shoes I think should be O.K.
At first I was helping to seill the tickets - it was n't difficult .
We had to check evey plug , switch , light .
I could n't belive how big a lamp can be .
fortunetly nothing had happend .
Only people who were helping and organizating this concert could meet her .
Some of them were speaking with her , I was n't this lucky person , but still I 'm happy , that I could be thear .
Log cabins may be more confortable . On the other hand I think that I will be able to " survive " in a tent .
I vish you had been here with me .
You can not imagine how dissapointed I was with myself .
We started to put everthing on the stage and after this we realized that the band was coming onto the stage near us .
After all of this we saw the show from the best place , near the stage and afterwards , the thing that I most liked , we were convidated to see the group and got their signatures .
I have got a few things to complain about regarding your theart .
I deciced to go and visit your theatre restaurant .
For example , once people had to walk from one place to another , but now we can use sciene and technology to produce a lot of petrol - powered vehicles and we can travel faster with them .
We can also use techlogy to produce more food and help them grow faster .
The rules at home are very different . I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie enough to aprove .
It is not allways easy , but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them .
I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesistate to contact me .
In addition to this , you may have some roboters bringing the newspaper to the table , tidying up the house , and doing the shopping . Maybe they will also be your life patners .
I and my friend Emma helped to paint the scence on the stage .
As you know , I like drawing and painting when I have some free time so that is why I chose to paint the scence .
Moreover , the restaurant was still under construction so that we could n't use it when we were extlemely hungry .
One of the biggist things that have changed is the change in the methods of communication .
I have mentioned a few changes above but there 's still the biggist one left , which is related to the field of computers .
I refer to your advertisment in the Herald Tribune where you advertised the Circle Theatre and the recent musical :
When we arrived at the theatre we realised that there were no discount tickets available as were mentioned in your advertisment so we had to buy the most expensive ones .
I am looking forward to your promt reply .
Today the fashion industrie has a great importance in the commercial market .
There are the natural materials on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produces more and more syntetical materials , which relay on the production cost .
In 100 years most clothes will be made from syntetical material .
The contrast will be especially attractiv .
Furthermore the style of the clothes is going to be more crazy and individuell but there will still be enumerous clothes for conservative people .
On balance fashion in 100 years time will be confortable and colourful .
There will be clothes for everyone 's tast .
Our school is really very diciplined , especially about our clothes and behaviour .
When I read the advertisement , it said that the restaurand would be open .
On behalf of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised , especially the idea of visiting a galery .
I grew up through the water world and I could n't live whitout it .
I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp . By the way , my team and I won the last scholl championship . I play guard on my team . I also like tennis but I am not very good . I was wondering if you could give me some lessons while I am there .
I do not have words to express how happy I am . I would like to thank you and Camp California for this oportunity .
Since man became man he has needed to hunt to survive . In ancient times he used spears , bows and arrows , and the wemon 's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff .
Nowadays , in the year 2000 we still practise this ancient art but in a diferent way , we do n't use weapons for hunting animals in the jungle , we use the remote to hunt TV shows , and we do not collect vegetables any more , we go shopping .
This activity of shopping has become one of our most important , after all , we go shopping for any reason , we have developed such an instinc for shopping that we can proudly say that we are some sort of kings of the urban jungle .
If an activity has stayed with us , mankind , for so long , it must give us some pleasure and maybe that 's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price marked on it , that is the greatest of extasis .
But where is the bad part of it ? Well shopping can became horrible at christmast for example , when houndred of people go to the shopping center and it also can cause many problems when you become an impulsive buyer .
Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors .
One could be when you go into a shop and you find something that you like , and you decide to buy it , but when you see the price , you find out that it 's too expencive , and you can not afford to buy it .
This cituation is very annoying for most people , and that 's what makes shopping unejoyable .
Why do n't we include some sports , for example , voleyball ?
Furthermore , it 's a worthful experience for people who want to know about other countries ' arts .
Finally , with regard to tickets , it is a really wonderful idea because it is more combinient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people .
One day , when the old man went into the bambo bush , he found some bambo gritted white .
He had never seen such bambo before but decided to cut it down .
THE KIND OF ACCOMODATION I PREFER IS A TENT BECAUSE AT SOMMER CAMP I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING SLEEPING OUTSIDE UNDER THE SKY WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE AND WARM .
IM QUITE GOOD AT PLAYING BASKETBALL BECAUSE I USED TO PLAY FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AT SCHOOL . WE USED TO HAVE TRAINING SESSIONS TWICE A WEEK AND AT LEAST TWO GAMES A MONTH AGAINST ANOTHER SCHOOL , WHICH WAS GREAT .
PAINTING ALWAYS DID FASCINATE ME , EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT SO GOOD AT IT , BUT MY FRIENDS SAY I CAN REALLY PAINT AND THEY LOVE THE THINGS I DO . THE TECHNIK I LIKE THE MOST IS WATERCOLORS .
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY EXPIERENCE HELPING AT THE POP CONCERT IN OUR TOWN ?
The reason I 'm writting this letter to you is that during my stay in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre .
After all the inconvenients that made me feel really mad . I think I can only forgive your theatre if you give me a refund of the money I spent there , and some more for all the problems I had .
As you already know , I am trying to become a professional photographer , consequently I would choose photograpy as the first activity and painting as the second .
However , I would like to know if by any chance the photograpy activities are only for beginners .
Actualy most people work hard to earn their money and consequently , the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful , or simply something they like , should be considered a very pleasant occasion .
In fact , the shopping you do for your daily needs is seldom enjouble , as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morover you are often faced with some nasty situations .
First of all , when I paid my entrance fee they did n't acept my discount ticket , they told me that the ticket was fake , then I entered the theatre and I had to wait 45 minutes . The show was suposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15 , " this shows a lack of respect " .
Manager , I spect that you have considered my bad experience at your theatre , so I 'm asking you for my money back , because it was a very bad evening .
It all started when Pat , Nick 's best friend , wanted to have the party at his house . Most of the class disagreed with that because the Pat 's house is extremly little , they started to say to him that his house was like a box .
Pat got very angree and sad .
At first Nick got angree but then he forgave him because they were friends and each of them could trust in the other .
Nick told the situation to the class and ofered his house for the party , because it was very big , with large gardens and a big swimming pool .
To begin with the wchool rules , we have in fact some important ones .
Since I have studied photography for several years , I would like to take some pictures of beautiful scenaries in California .
I had to pay the full price for them , which was quite expencive .
It turned out to be impossible : the restaurant was closed and we did n't even receive an explaination .
The developpement of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones , has greatly changed our way of life .
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and anytime , even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other .
Precision industry has changed my life a lot too . I go Scuba Diving during the weekends and hollydays .
I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in Auguest .
How can shopping be enjoyable in thoese situation !
I belived everything she told me .
I was surprised that he belived me .
Yours sincerelly ,
They are human beings and they need to keep a little bit of pirvacity and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people , to feel that they are unknown and anonymus and they do not have to wear sunglasses , hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognised .
Furthermore , you asked me to choise two activities I would like to do .
And now for them shopping can be considerated like a contrariety .
It is quite obvious that celebreties ca n't lead a normal life , as they are constantly followed by reporters , which makes their life miserable .
I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is wildely discussed in the mass - media .
Last of all , it says in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant open after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was being redecorated and no annocement was made .
Therefore I would like are refund of my ticket and I would like an apolygists .
Yours Sincelery ,
What do you think modles will wear on the catwalks ?
In my opinion , clothes will be a lot differente in 100 years ' time .
For the accomodation at Camp California , I would prefer to have a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent , and in case there is a big storm with heavy rain . A log cabin 's more resistant than a tent .
For the activities , I chose climbing because I took a cours for 2 weeks last year and now I have a good level of proficiency . For the other one I chose photography but I am not a proffesional , I just take some pictures on my holiday !
Next weekend I have a date with one of them , but I wo n't tell you the name because you 'll feel jalous !
I would like to do photografy and swimming .
I love to take photos but I do n't have any techinique .
Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves , like clothes , jewelery , anything .
When you buy something you were looking for a long time and , when you arrive at home , you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain .
Secondly , I would like to choose a tent for accommodation , because I have never spent time in a tent , that 's why , I think it is a good oppotunity for me .
I have planty of experience and knowledge of both aspect of part .
I would be greatfull if you could inform me .
My jobs were collecting tickets , saling goods and refreshments , guiding people to the right seat and cleaning up the concert hall after the concert finished .
What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achived through our support .
I really recomend you to help them , I think this is a good oppotunity and I want you to understand my feeling well .
I want to know your openion .
On the other hand , their stories always make them embarras because most of the journalists create their own story based on the true story just to get the people 's attention .
All of them were schoked by what they heard .
She became very shy and engry . She could n't talk with people and she was just very sad .
I want to tell you that I am very dissapointed about the play .
In the advirtisement it said that Danny Brook was in the starring role .
And also it should have started at 19.30 , as I saw in the advirtisement , but it started at 20.15 !
And so far there were n't any discounts available which were said to be " available " in the advirtisement .
You should have written it in the advirtisement .
Absolutely it was very dissapointing
I hope you understand and will correct your mistakes in the next advirtisement and send me my money soon !
Today 5 out of every 10 pupils can use a computer basicly .
It is really enjable when I chat with people .
Techology is also important in another area for me .
But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writting something on the board .
Unfortunatelly I have to complain about the musical show put on in your Circle Theatre last night .
When I received your advertisment concerning the show " Over the Rainbow " I thought that I 'd have a great evening , but unfortunatelly it was a big disappointment for me .
First of all , Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was abbsend .
You also offered discounts - whot kind of discounts ?
Becouse the show was very long , we were getting hungry but of course your theatre restaurant was closed because of the holiday .
I had not any money for travelling and my parents were going to give me some only if I had concret plans .
After one mounth , I went back home and told my parents what a lot of fun I had with my friends - I do n't know why I was such a liar .
My parents belived my story untill my younger brother Pat told them the truth .
Now my parents do n't belive my story .
I hope you will not feel offensed , but I really need to complain about your theater .
You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not performing and I was more bewildered that no one made an apologie for it !
Although , I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket , as you mentionned in the advertisement , but unfortunately , these could n't possibly be given either !
If more and more ingenors work in science and technology , it must be because it is really usefull : but in what particular way ?
I would like to travel at the beginning of the month , which could be between the first and the fifteeth of July , because afterwards I have several business meetings and it would be difficult for me to take a trip .
Although I like camping and sharing with different kinds of people , I 'd prefer a confortable and private place ( if it 's possible ) where I can sleep , or be quiet .. I am not a teenager !
I was running the whole show . My responsability was to dress her .
I relly liked the exhibitions .
The band " Three Kings " apresented a new stily of music .
I would like to notice that the dance show was absolutelly marvelous .
What a greit idea to invite writers ! I relly liked talking with them .
You wrote an advertisment saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit this concert , but there were artists from only 6 countries .
It was relly a pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy .
The International Arts Festival was organised quite well . I would only recomended you have more artists and the classical concert should be in a bigger hall .
They were so poor that somitimes they hardly had anything to eat .
She persuide him to go to the sea to ask for a lot of things for her .
Also , the e - mail system is really hepful .
Circle Theater
Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined , it was definitely not the " perfect evening " as written in the adverstiment .
Syntethic materials have developed and become very popular so they would keep going .
I guess they will wear a sort of tunique over a shirt and a skirt , or more masculine clothes because they want to change .
About the accomodation , I would prefer a tent because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities .
In conclusion , like all things in life , shopping can be pleasent or irritating depending on your patience and on your mood that day .
It gives us knowledge usefull for many school clubs , like the " marathon shell " club or the robotich club .
Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mechanical engineer and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mechanical engineer . It lets us identify our abilities and the part of mecanics that we prefer .
Our engineering school is specealized in mecanics and thermodynamics .
First , we could film the fluid mecanics lessons and the general mecanics lessons .
I wonder if we could not feet between some short view of the laboratories , in which we could show a student doing experimentations .
Futur students could appreciate coming if they could still do their sport .
Another point to record woubl be the time we have got between lessons or at lunch time . It will show a part of the way of life in the school .
If possible , the type of accomodation I prefer is a tent .
I will be very glad to partecipate in your camp !
Yours faightfully
The show 's date is very convinient - March 14 - , and it is on in the Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there .
Although this statement is absuletely true , it seems there is no way to stop public attention , so they will have to keep living with journalists .
My name is Marcia Fomalar , I am writting to let you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical at the London theatre .
I went to buy a ticket and as I like to enjoy the show near the stage I bought a £ 20 tiket but when I asked for a discount they told me , " I am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement . It will be impossible to give you a discount " .
At 19:15 I was very impatient , waiting for the show to begin , and a man anounced that the show would start at 20:15 .
Finaly the show started and to my sorprise my favourite actor Danny Brooke had been replaced by another actor .
Pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ruined .
The other activity that I chose is painting . I am not as good as I want , nevertheless I think I can inprove my skills during this course .
I would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so I can bring with me the appropiate clothes and the last thing I need to know is the amount of money that I have to bring with me .
To make this report easier and faster , it was necessary to make a questionarie which was given out in the school .
However , 15% thougth that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important .
As you can see , my clasemates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have .
A few weeks ago , my family and I had a hoilday in London . The hoilday was n't too good !
During the week we descide where we wanted to go . We all agreed to listen to music so then we descide to go to your musical show and listen to " Over the Rainbow " .
That evening we did n't want to have our supper before the show . Anyway I thought it would be too early to eat and also because the timetable or canidates you give me have say : " visit our theatre restaurant after the show " .
So we did , but unforturnily it was closed and I was so dissapointed about it , not only because we had expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove to be the actor of starring .
We do n't expect much bad to happen on our hoilday , but this was a perfectic show as well , it was the worst show and theatre I have ever been to in my life .
sincinerly Ki
To help us to live happily , sciencetist can easily perdict the changes on earth , so that we can have time to perpare or defend ourselves from natural diseasters .
Wapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight . In the Second World War so many Germans were killed . Also many people died in other regions ,
Posin chemical compounds , e.g. gases and liquids , are created too . They have been used to kill people . Most of them produce radiration , which can disable a person , mostly harming their brain and their bodies , and it can also cause death .
Communication techology , e.g. internet ( networks ) and moible phones .
In wars soilors communicate with moible phones though places to place to get or give information about themselves and the enarmys .
By using the Internet we can make new pen friends overseas , and creat clubs and sociatys .
Now a megsage can travel quicker and it is also worldwide . sending letters takes about a week from Hong Kong to the U.K. , but network , e.g.
Modern technology saves us a lot of time and brings us many benifects when we use it in the right way , but some bad way to e.g. send virse to break down network .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party was n't as succesful as we thought .
We decided to go to his place ( I 've got a copy of the key ) the evening before his birthday while he was at work and decorate the lounch , then turn off the lights and wait for him in silence until he arrived .
With reference to our trip to London , on behalf of all of us , the English class in this college , we would like to thank you for your special atention in organising a good programme to learn about the interesting and cultural places in London .
We have been very excited about this and coincidentely we have found another option to add to our programme , certainly if you agree with it .
We thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformations nowdays in England concerning fashion , leisure , sports and lifestyle .
It was dangerous , but I kew I had to do it .
I was at home putting my makeup on before going to a restaurant with my friends and , sudenlly , he rang the bell . He was so tense with a gun in his hands and I could no longer speak . He took me out with him .
I had tried to think about stopping him , but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he forced me to buy cocain using my cheques .
I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , of wich you are the manager .
Although it was written in the show 's addvertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook , it , unfortunately , was not him .
It was also written in the show 's addvertisement that there would be discounts available on the tickets .
Even though the addvertisement said we should visit it after the show , it was closed and no explanations were given .
In conclusion , the addvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out , but it was not , so I would like to ask for my money back .
One day , I inocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe , the school 's hunk and most popular boy .
Suddenly , an enourmous saddness caught me , because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone , so he would definately break up with me , and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat , because she had just ruined my happiness and I could n't trust her anymore .
One day , while I was studying maths , one of my friends , called Pat , asked me to have a coffe with her .
The problem started when I confesed to her that I had fallen in love with Larry , who was my cousin 's boyfriend .
Surprizingly there was a completely different actor starring .
Unfortunatly the restaurant was closed .
He is only looking for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccesfull for 86 days .
Little by little we were growing up and becaming close friends .
I relyied on her and our relationship was excellent .
It is my only favorite hobby .
To reply to your question , it was realy a nice experience .
As you know , I like pop music so much and the singer was one of my favorite singers .
I would be most greatful if you could let me have some information :
- Are there leisure and intertainments facilities close to the camp ?
I am really surprised for the information because I won , and I would like to say thank you for everyting . This is why I wrote and sent this letter with the information you need I can only travel in July because it is the only time when I can do it before for my work I do not really care what accommodation I will have . I would prefer to come in July I will be avaliabel for the moment . I would really apreciated it if you could tell the people who work at Camp California I choose the Golf and Photography because I think I am really interested in those subjects . I am not really really good but I have some experience .
I think that is everyting I would like to know .
I want to apologise to you , because I haven't written to you recently , but I want to tell you what hapend to me last week . I had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city . So imagen , I felt really really good and excited . I do n't have words to describe it but I will try to do it , OK ?
What 's more , your letter said about the chance to do two acctivities during the camp .
I have even won a competion once .
I would like to know if the , , travel costs '' which you had paid include entrance tickets to the museums or any other cultural places , because I would like to do some sightseeing in the U.S.A. Furthermore , if there will be cmy tumple dryer or washing maschine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp .
When discribing the advantages , we should remember that most people like doing shopping .
Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need .
From my point of view it depands on us whether shopping will be enjoyable or not .
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show Over the Rainbow , wich took place in your stablishment , The Circle Theater , which made me feel very upset .
I was very excited to see it yesterday , but as soon as I arrived at the theater the problems began .
Yours Sincerelly ,
Firstly , the great boom in mass comunication wich happened at the beginning of our decade , with the devellopment of telephones , radio stations , television and even satelites , and of course , the Internet , gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world , and this allowed health and education research to increase as well .
In addition to that , people will always be affraid of a technological war .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people must learn that despite technology being such a new area to explore , we have to use it with a great deal of responsability for us all to survive in the future .
And is there anything eles I have to take with me ?
Yes , it is true . This is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before , and some women do n't earn money . They have no idea how diffcult it is to earn money .
It would be wonderful to buy some books or programms with the signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival .
I hope this letter will help you with organying the festival .
Every puple has to sit alone . ( I mean that one desk is given to one person . )
2 . One should have such marks as , , 3 " , , , 4 " , , , 5 " , not , , 2 " , which is eaqual to fail .
We do n't have old - traditioned rules or anything like that .
First of all , it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest mounth in the year , and the weather will be really nice .
Despite my lack of expereance in climbing I do want to try this type of sport .
The aim of this report is to suggest wich lessons and other activities should be filmed .
I have enterwed each student from my English class .
Fistly , the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving their noleges .
It contributes to the world 's treasure house of literature and arouses an irresistable fascination .
We should n't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college , especially if we take into consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear .
Also , painting is one of my favorite things !
Anyway , I really enjoyed helpying at a pop concert last month so that I 'd like to write about it !
Anyway , by the time we finished everything , thusands of funs came into this concert hall .
I 'm writting to you with reference to the letter I have received from you saying I have won your competition .
Well , as you ask , I will tell you I would like to travel as soon as July begins , I 'm going to be able only to travel in that month because of my job responsabilities .
Regarding the choice of tents or log cabins , I think I will turn to the first one because I have always loved camping close to nature , if possible , in front of a lake or a river , if your campsite has one , so that I will be able to do my favorite and skillful hobby : sailing .
I would like to travel only in July , because I have only one month 's holliday this year .
It is not too confortable , but that is not a problem for me . I like this kind of holliday .
I never had met pop stars before and I was very impresed , but I was too happy to show my shyness .
I stayed with him until the concert began and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dansers .
So , unfortunately , I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had , and having given the reasons , I expect to be able to count on your sense of responsability , so , I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds I spent on that terrible night .
Also , with today 's machines , factories have significantly increased their production , which brings progress to humanity , but also , with the continous replacement of men by machines , unemployment is increasing too , and today , it worries every single citizen of the world , specially the ones who live in third world countries .
It would be a fun experiance !
Women , in perticular , have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see .
This was the best thing that had ever happend to the Fennall family for yeats .
Which was very chooking for her mother .
SINCE I HAVE A CHOICE OF ACCOMODATION , I'LL DEFINETELLY GO FOR THE LOG CABIN , BECAUSE I CAN'T BEAR THE HEAT INSIDE A TENT .
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE WEATHER CONDITIONS , SO I CAN DECIDE ON WHAT CLOTHES TO TAKE , AND ABOUT COSTS , SO I CAN MAKE A BUDJET FOR THE HOLIDAY .
AFTER THE STAGE WAS BUILT , THE REST OF THE THINGS I HAD TO DO WERE QUITE EASY AND ENJOYABLE ; I COULD STAY EITHER BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF THE STAGE AND GIVE A HAND IF NEEDED . I REALLY ENJOYED IT BECAUSE I LEARNT A LOT OF TECNICAL THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW ; AND WHAT I ALSO ENJOYED WAS THE GOOD PAY !
I 'm writting to you to complain about a play I have seen , called : " Over the rainbow " .
It was clear that Pat had to change and show his friends that they could believe in him thrutly .
For those next few days , Pat would do his best to be as sympathic as possible .
To begin with , every morning Pat said a pleasant " hello " and added to that a big smail .
His mother always says : " If you are smailing and are nice to people , poeple will be nice and will smail at you " .
I would preffer to travel in July . I have only this time , because my summer holidays are during these days .
A cabin reminds me too much of my home and is too confortable . That is n't what I want to have if I stay in a wild area .
I was able to ask anybody , and he answered in detail , althoug he had a lot of work .
I 'm writing to you followwing our visitting to your theatre last night .
And I would like to know if it is posible to have our money back .
And if someone elso knew , I would n't be able to go back to heaven unless I killed the person who told my secret .
And I would like to go in the first part of this month , the socond part I spend with my familly .
While I will be at the Camp I would like sailing , because it is my favorite sport .
Yours faitfully
In my opininion this book ' The Old Man and the sea ' is the best book which Ernest Hemingway wrote .
Thise book is about a man who knows that he will die soon , he knows that he did n't make his dream come tru .
So he decidet to go for a last trip in his life .
He needs to rest , but he does n't geve up .
In the end he makes his drems come tru , he catches a vast Marlin .
In thise book Hemingway is trying to tell us , that if we want something , we can get it , it might be deficult and take a long time but we can do it .
Sometimes they geve up , befor they get something ,
I read the advertisement and I thought it was going to be a plesent evening .
From the beggining it was all a disappointment .
When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with my student card , but that was not posible .
I let this pass and I bought it anyway , thinking that it was posible that this was only a mistake in your advertisement .
But the play started fourty - five minutes late , and the star of the show , of whom I 'm a great fan an who was the main reason for why I decided to see the play , had been changed for another actor , who turned out to be really bad .
I think you realise why I 'm writting this letter to ask you to give me my money back .
All the things that were promised in your advertisement were untrue , and it was definitly NOT the perfect evening out .
Specting that you will resolve this misunderstanding .
There 's no doubt that modern tecnology has changed our lives , but how ?
I think that some of the changes have been very good , like the impruvement in medical science , which now can save millions of people that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives .
It has changed the ways people comunicate .
But tecnology has not only changed our lives in a good way , giving us things that can make our lives more confortable , it has also created things that are n't bad , but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the world .
Weapons and factories are destroing our planet and we need to realise that we have to use tecnology to impruve our lives , while always triying to respect nature .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer to stay in tents rather than log carbins because I have a lot of experience of putting up my own tents .
I like to go window shopping that is good to go arround the shopping centre .
Then I can say I definatly do n't feel it is enjoyable .
- Accomodation : a log cabin would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California .
Before we can give our opinions on this statemant we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing .
We do not speak here about luxuary goods .
But if you realize how important what you buy is for your health you will go shopping with a far greater consiousness and more joy than before . '
How incredable it is !
I love swimming and also I 've got a scubar diving licence .
I used to enjoy floting on the water whenever I was on holiday .
Singing is the most favarite hobby for us .
I 'd like to know how much monery , and how many clothes we need .
Of couse , the shopkeepers are human beings as well .
But for their considerations , they 're working in their rutines .
I sometimes lose my desire to buy a thing because of their bad behaviers .
For example , for our jobs , supecial ceremonies , and so on .
Your advertisement also failed to mention the fact that there were no discounts whatsoever and , finally , because of a shortage of staf , your restaurant was not open .
I asked myself how I could be so stupied , telling her my secret after all I had been going through to keep it to myself .
Now I did n't need to go around worring about it anymore .
I decieded to thank Pat , and maybe , if possible , teach her a lession .
I pretended to be totaly miserable .
Pat did n't know what to do . She apoligised over and over again and I could really see that she was more than devestated .
After hugging eatch other we promised never to tell others about our secrets .
However , it was deleied and it started at 20.15 .
The theatre restaurant was closed after the show , they said funds had runn out .
Those are totally unexpectable so I would like to get paid for my ticket cost .
I ask you to transfor money into this account .
Think about the conputer , the speed of conputer is much faster than before .
Nowdays , technology keeps developing and better technology gives us an easier life .
In the hopeness that you understand me .
Unfortunely , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
At first , when he had a girlfriend , they talked to each other franckly .
But after they seperated , he told his friends her secrets without thinking .
It is like one of his bad habbits .
It was a very unpleasent evening .
The restaurant should have been oppened when I came out , but it was closed because of the time the show finished .
After breakfeast I have to use my car to get to school .
Without technology I would get realy bored .
I would be very grateful to recieve answers to my questions .
Boy , he 's really really handsom !
Secondly , the show was meant to begin at 19.30 pm , actually it began at 20.15 pm and that was without giving any explainations !
Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobil phone .
Sometimes the ring is annoying but , finally , the mobil phone is a great , handy object .
About the acommodation , from the two options , I choose to sleep in a tent , because I think that a log cabin is n't as authentic as a tent , at the camp .
I would be greatful if you could send me further information about details like how much money or what kind of clothes I 'll have to take with me .
You know that I 'm a little bit lazy , but the main reason for not writting to you has been the accummulation of exams during this month .
There I was impressed by how a singer can cause such histerism in teenagers .
During the two - hour concert we had to attend to thirty - six people who became inconscious after being trapped in the first row by the other people .
Answering the second question , I would prefer my accomodation to be in log cabins .
And when it finaly started , it was n't Danny Brook who performed .
After the show I wanted to drink somthing in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started too late !
So I ask you sincearly for my money back becaus it was n't a perfect evening out .
I told her that my parents are getting divorsed and that I will move to Chicago with my mother .
One day , Pat and I were going home , when she asked me if I would give a party befor I go .
I had to tell her that I did n't have the time to organise anything becaus we , my mother and I , had to get our stuff ready to move .
But when we got into the hous ther were all my friends !
We had a great evening becaus Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets !
I am writting to give the information you asked me for and also I would like to request some information about the prize .
Furthermore I would like to choose to stay in a tent instead of a cabin because I think it could be more exciting and could provide more contact with the enveiroment .
He had a puncture and he did n't know how to repeared it . Then I changed the tyre and during this time he was asking me about my hobbies , studies , everything .
I am writting to you in order to give you some details you asked me for in your letter .
The job was hard , but , from my point of view , it was worthful .
The most exhiting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert , and we went to the Highlands to spend the whole day there .
That was fantactic !
If you have never been there , I really recemmend you to go .
But we decided to buy a picture , because she had always told us about art galleries with great exitement .
Yours sinecerely
Despite the fact that going to school by bus was easier than going by bycyle , I had preferred going to school by bycyle to going by bus .
When I went to see her play , I realy would love to be an actress .
It was my dream . I wish my dady
Aspecially in the summer when the tempereture and humidity are very high .
From the list of all the activities I have choosen photography and golf .
I have choosen golf because I have never played this game .
My friend offered me a job as a member of the techical staff at Sting 's concert .
We 've built it using ready metal and wodden parts .
I was working with a specialist who had to connect all the lights together to one computer and prepare a colorful show .
It was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure working with professionalists .
For me - the dance shows were absolutelly wonderful .
I prefere them to others .
We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably priced ticket for all the evants because we could change our plans during the evant .
Most studenst wear jeans and a sweater .
Next year , you should calulate or examine how many people will come before you choose a hall , which I feel very good was plays and films .
And the offer of a " weedend ticket " was an excellent idea .
Because the price was cheaper than buying it sperate and more convience .
Yours Sinicerely ,
Finally , food shops should be added to this festival next year because only plays and films were not atrractive enought to get audiences .
Yours sencirely ,
However , I can go out wheneve I want , even at midnight .
Secoundly , boys are not allowed to have long hair .
I feel that they would be fabulos places with a western design .
Another disadvatage of the festival 's programme was the lack of plays and films which are the best to display a modern country 's culture , I think .
In conclusuon , I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be made .
Fortunatelly , there are many ways to earn some money nowadays .
In addition to baby - sitting , you may also give some lessons to small children such as ( tl ) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language , Eglish , for example .
But if you do n't like children and are not easy - going enough to work as a waiter you may choose the more pieceful job of a typist at home .
So , you can help them and earn quiete enough .
Moreover , men prefer to do sports , because shopping wastes a lot of time , which is controry to the tastes of women , because if they have any free time , they will go shopping .
Finally , I would be interested in meeting artists from everywhere in the world not only Europeen artists .
In conclusion , I had an unforgetable time .
The restaurant was closed because there was n't any electricity . You should close the theatre untill the restaurant can be used .
I was totaly unsatisfied with the theatre and I would like to have my money back if that 's possible .
I 'm quite sure that people all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people , especialy women , who like to be very elegant and beautiful , will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that 's it .
You ca n't be carefull because you do n't know what time it will happen .
But you can be carefull when you speak with he or she who is stealing your things .
I am writing this as a reply to your request to provide you with some information about my preferencies .
I am not so keen about the accomotation but would rather stay in tents than cabins .
We live near the seashore and swimming is the sports activitie I am really good at .
Somitimes I feel very sorry for her .
Lots of families plan a day out to go to a shopping center , and it is a normal routine for them - to spend all day just shopping .
I would like the trip to start in July if possible . Because this is my Hoilday start at the Camp California , I would like my accommodation in a tent , because I work in the Army and on the camp I usually stay in a tent at night , so I will feel more comfortable .
Regarding the activities I would like to choose Swimming and climbing for my activities at the camp ; I usually do these two activities on the Army Camp . I know how to climb up on Rachiat outside and help other people to climp up .
To make a daily life video in school , we should concentrat on the things we do most in a school . The thing we do most in a school is have lessons . It will be a very useful part of this video and should be the main subject .
At the end of the video , we should find one or two studen sit together and ask them a few questions about how they feel about studying at the school ? This is the suggestion to making a daily life video in school .
It would be greatful .
And we could n't wear any colorful clothes and socks .
I 'm pursuading my mum , perhaps .
I am writing in response to your advertisment in today 's newspaper .
In addition to this , I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in the sommer .
Unfortuneatly , Daniela fainted .
This story happend a long time ago .
Now Pat realized what was going on and could undstand why her boyfriend got so nervous about the secret .
Nevertheless , I lost my concerntration on my studies and I spent the money on entertainment .
I will never ever help anybody to organice a pop concert again .
But after this serville work I met Eminem .
As regards painting , I know a lot about it since my grandmother taugh me when I was five years old .
She also told me that she has some conections with the people in charge of the lights at the concert .
Since I am going to travel I would like to know how much money it would be adviseable to take and what kind of clothing I should take .
Or approximately how much money would be enough to buy surveniers because this will be the first time for me visiting Carifolnia .
Finaly , I must choose travelling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work .
However , things which you can get with money do not necessarily fill your unsatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more , your emptiness might be greater .
And shopping is also a difficult hobby to go along with your friends or your pertners .
On the whole , shopping can be harmful rather than enjoyable because you migh be extravacant , lose your friends and have what you do n't need .
We think we could change the shooping to go to the show .
To sum up , there is no perfect job , and being famous involves a lof of money , but also a lot of jouralists following your private life .
All the group would enjoy going to the show , because it is a great oportunity to see an exhibition of the latest fashions .
For example , we ca n't go to the toliet during lessons . We have to go there in the break .
It 's too strickt . I do n't like it .
My name is Sandre Atos , I am writting to you because last weekend I went to the theatre you manage , to see what was called " London 's newest and best musical show " .
That 's why I am writting to ask for some money back ; I believe I have this right .
Unfortunatly my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us .
On the other hand , due to scientific developments , I am getting better , recovering from ahsma .
I had a very dissappointing evining last Saturday .
I had everythig planned ; my family and I were coming to whatch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous .
Then everything was going well untill the show did n't start !
That was a dissapointment for my whole family . In fact all the audience were very dissappointed .
Anyway the show was nowhere near as good as it was meant to be and it was definately worse than I had expected it to be . I did n't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress .
So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes , desparately searching for your restaurant , our stomachs rumbling for food .
What kind of an organasation do you call this , sir / madam ?
You do n't understand how dissappointed and angry I was that night .
In fact he was one of the principal busybodies of his neighborhood and his school so not a lot of people in his school liked him .
Some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously , maby just a bit too seriously . They gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends , and started picking on younger people , or mempers of other gangs , trying to start fights with them .
This whent on and on , got more and more serious , but it was so secret that the teachers did n't notice .
Everyone in the year was anoyed , but not with Pat , oh , no !
exept a few phcyco groups . Some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party , just for the fun and meanness of it .
Everyone was enjoying themselves exept Pat , who had heard about the raid .
The time had come . The who groups had comdined their forces and were ready to strike .
Lots of People wher injured and even more were suspended the next day at school , when the Headmaster found out what had happened .
Pat recieved no punishment at all and he was n't blamed for anything by his teachers or friends .
But he felt awfull because he knew that all this had happened because of him .
Do you like do - it - yourself and is your house full of marvellous but unuseful things ? You could sell them to a specialised shop and finally tidy up your room !
I am writing in response to the International Arsts Festival , which took place on 21 - 22 November .
I would like to inform you that it was a great idea and a valuable activitie as a social event .
However , it was a dissapointment when I realised that not many countries were attending the event . I would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the world , for instance , the Far East , Indonesia etc .
On the other hand , I enjoyed being one of the people seeing the plays films , the dance shows which were brillantly performed and the art exbitions .
Finally , I preciate your organisation and look forward to hearing about the next International Arts Festival .
What a pitty !
Privat schools have a more relaxed atmosphere than the state schools .
Of course smoking is n't allowed in any part of the schol .
Apart from that I would n't mind at all whether I stay in tents or log cabins but if I have to choose between these two I 'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation . It is very unusal to stay in log cabins while you are camping .
Photography is a very interesting activitie , and is not too hard to do either .
Worst of all , at the end of the Musical , I went to your Theatre Restaurant , in order to have dinner , because I had leaft home without eating and so I was hungry at that time .
First of all , modern technology has changed my daily life in the last five years more quickly than in anchient times , or even than a decade ago .
Nowadays , I ca n't go one day without consulting computer communications via e - mail or the Internet . I exchange corespondecies with all my family via the Internet , with my mother and 2 brothers who live in Curitilra City and also with a brother who lives in Italy and another who is living in New Zealand .
It 's written in the regulament that we ca n't leave the school during the breaks ; we ca n't smoke near the classrooms ; we have to justify our absences or lateness and even if you 're over eighteen your parents have to justify you with the teacher .
Regarding accomodation I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I enjoy the closeness to nature while camping a lot .
I sort of felt like I had done my part to make the concert a sucess .
The show is going to be on Tuesday the 14 of March from 10.00 to 19.00 and we fained it very interesting , because we will have the opportunity to see mews , firstly about the latest fashions , secondly concerning leisure and sports wear and finally about make - up and hairstyles .
Thank you very mutch !
Most of the time they have journalists following them everywhere , looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper , and I do n't think this is very nice , but it is the price that famous people have to pay , just becouse they are popular .
Anyway , this is not always necessarily a problem , but it can be a big thing for the famous person , becouse it gets people talking about him and increases his popularity .
In conclusion , I can say that this is not the biggest problem that the world has and -- it is not my problem becouse I am not famous !
Concidently the show is in London and on Tuesday March 14 , which is during the period we are in London for the three - day programme .
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , because morality and priciples are also concerned .
I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana dying in the car crash was one of the most disarster examples .
Although we can not deny it is our nature - we are curious - we can improve our sence of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them .
Basle , 12th Decembre 2000
In your letter , you asked me wheter the book I 've read would be a suitable present for your cousin 's fifteenth birthday .
You wrote that your cousin is quite intered in magic , detectives and sport , did n't you ? I think this is the best choice for him !
As you know , we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle , and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discorve this aspect of your country !
Thank you for your letter , as usual , it 's a pleisure to receive news from you .
It 's a fantastique book , which I recommend to everybody keen on love stories .
It 's a perfect combinaison of passion and life 's difficulties .
I recone that it 's not an easy read , but as you described your cousin , I think she really will enjoy it , she 's so good at litteracy that it wo n't be a problem for her .
I really think you should choose this one for her , it does go with her personnality .
It 'll be a good point for her general education . Wuthering Heights is a classic , which everybody knows about , even if they haven't read it , they at liest know the story .
How has morden technology changed my life ?
A computer is extrrmely helpful with writing reports and essays .
But also I am not able to imagine my life without this nice way of reciving news with help of it .
I would be very greatful if you could let us go to the show .
Furthermore , addmission is free for students .
Unfortunately , our programm is fixed but I think we could change part of the programme .
Firstly , most people can remember the sad story of " Princess Diana " . She died in Paris a few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called " Paparach " .
However , secondly , famous people are not " ailen " so they might do something , for example , ashame things in a public space , or argue with a partner or family , even put on a swimming costume like us .
So they can be just ordinaly people like us .
Overall , people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people ... and then we can find the answer that all people , including famous people , need a private life and would like to have an ordinaly life .
They were eagar to have a child , but they had never been able to .
About when I would like to travel , I think that my answer will be easy for you , because I have two months off , those are July and August , so my trip should be in between . Regarding my accomodation I would like to stay in a tent because I remember my holidays in the south of Peru , a long time ago ; it was wonderful .
If it is possible for you to help me clear up some doubts I have , I 'll be really greatful .
Yours faitfull .
First of all , I 'll tell you that on the day of the concert I woke up at 6:30 a.m. , very early for me . You know me , I 'm lazzy . The work began around 8:30 . It was very hard but then the band came to rehearse . From that moment I enjoyed working until the concert had finished . The atmosphere was wonderful , the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team .
Finally , we would like to get your permition to go . Maybe if it is possible that you can change your programme , we can go to your college any time after Tuesday .
This story happed two years ago .
Not only was I a member of the swimming team in our school , but also I had been tought by my father since I was five years old .
I started thinking about it . After all , either had I neve done this task before , or trained .
It was really a reasonably priced weekend for me , but you should also introduce new activities like competitions in singing songs or drawing a portrate next year .
Secondly , the show should have started at 19:30 p.m. , and it began fourty - five minutes late .
Moreover , when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were avaliable .
Furthermore , I wanted to have a coffe after the show , but when I tried to get to the theatre restaurant , it was closed .
Ballons and coloured lights were put in all the trees .
I carried a lot of chairs and looked after the que or people who lost their way .
As we are going to be in London on this date , we think it could be a great oppurtunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions , make up , etc . and it is free for students .
Because of this , we would kindy ask you to change the programme so that we could go to this particular event .
A especiall invitation
It allowed people to enjoy their weekend , relax , and also it brought a foreign culture to them , broadening their kownlegth .
In addition to this , one weekend ticket for all the events was only £ 10 . This was excellent . It meant people only spent pocket - money , and then they could watch all the events at the weeked . For them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend .
Moreover , the stars and artists were from only six countries . In my opinion , if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries , it will make the festival more exciting , more intesting , and in my opinion , some of the concert halls were too small . The people in there could n't even go to the loo , because it was too crowded .
These are only my inmature views . If it is considerable for you , I will be very pleased . Thank you very much .
It was very uncamfortable for me .
Today I recived your letter . It is the most wonderful news I have heard in a long time .
I am so pleased that I won this prize that I can not explain how greateful I am .
Because of this situation I will be very busy in the first week of July , and I would apreciate it if you could give me the option to begin my " Camp California " experience on July 10th .
About the Accomodation I would prefer to sleep in a tent , because I have never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
Because I have seen my father playing golf since I was a child I am very keen on this sport , and also I love photography because I have got a great Camara .
When I was a child I never liked to go shopping because my Mum spent so much time in the shops that I remember that going shopping with her was a nigthmare .
It is ameaising how people change over the years For example now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things , and every week I have to buy something .
But these days shopping is not always enjoyable , because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price , at the end of the season it is half price . I find it very anfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes .
Anyway , shopping is allways satisfation for rich people , because they can afford it and they do n't mind paying the full price for their clothes .
Modern technology ca n't not transforme our daily life .
The inventions of the airplane , of the train and of the car , have reduced the distances of the world , so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day .
Everything has changed : style , colour , qual . Fashion .
We saw almost all kinds of skirts , trousers , coats , skirts and even hats - which untill now have been the main point of many fashion creatures .
Grey and black - like the seasons , like people 's charakters , like all the night and dark sourranding us .
In the advertisement , it said that Danny Brook was starring , but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really dissapointing .
As you can understand , it was a dreadful time and I want my money back as a consolation for the dissapointment I had .
I support this idea which is convinient both for the public and the organisators .
It is awfull !
However , we promised our perents to do some cleaning every week .
What is more , there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipement .
The second is nuclear weapons and the many wars in which modern equipement is used .
To sum up , as far as I am concidered , modern technology has changed my life completely .
Last week , during my holiday in London , I had the opportunity to see the show " Over the Rainbow " at the Circle Theathre .
The day of the show , we got to the theather at 19:30 .
Third , the theatre restaurant was closed because the cheff did not show up .
You can feel the fresh air and listen to the animals . This will be a great oportunety !
I am not good at either activity , but it will be a pleasure to try them , espacially surfing . I would like to feel the wind in my hair , and enjoy how quickly the board goes over the sea .
I mean , it is too crowdy , you have to wait such a long time before you can pay , and most of the things are too expensive !
I was looking forward to a great evening , but much to my surprise , that was not exactly the case : there were no discounts available , such as were mentionned in the advertisement ; the show started 45 minutes late ; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook had been replaced by someone else .
Yours faithfuly ,
I will take the exemple of the use of the Internet .
I am writting to you because yesterday I went to the musical " Over the Rainbow " and I had a bad evening .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because this is the beggining of my holidays , and I would not like to miss some of my school classes .
Besides , I would preffer to stay in a tent , because I got used to being in tents since I spend my holidays every summer with my friends in the hills .
In adittion , I would prefer playing tennis .
I also like surfing . I think it is a dangerous sport , but I know how to do it , because of the fact that last year a proffessional surfer tought me .
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSICAL SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " WICH WAS PERFORMED LAST WEEK .
YOURS SINCEARLY
Because I am a university student , I have got classes until the midle of June and I have to attend a ' Research and Development Conference ' at the end of June .
Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as an assistant from the beginning of Aguest .
I always want to buy T - shirts , Jeans , Skirts , cosmetics , haribands , accessories , rings , earings , bracelets , shoes , hats , bags , fancy stationery , interior stuff and CDs .
Insead of buying something , I buy some fresh food and Ice - cream .
I can try all the shoes , clothes , hats , accessories and jakect on .
Actually , I could have a chance to ask her about music , her favorite artist and her hobby .
Likewise , there were no discounts avalaible .
Because of all these inconvenients , I ask you for a total refund .
So when Caroline , his girlfriend , told him something personal and very important , because she trusted in him , immediatly he went to see one of his friends to tell him the secret .
So immediatly she went to Pat , angry , in order to argue with him , saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved , and that it was n't the first time that he was n't capable of keeping a secret .
But after I climbed two steps more , my right foot slipped . I nearly fell , but luckly my hand caught a rock . It was dangerous , but I did n't have any choice . Finally I did it .
I think it was definitely not the perfect evening garenteed in your advertisement .
I was terribly ennoyed !
I am always joinable on my mobile phone , which is also boring sometimes !
I often go on the Internet to find information when studying a particular subject more accutely ( university technology sites ) .
At work my particular job involves two standard PCs with specifical software plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network ( SUN ) operating system and a special computer that my firm is now developing .
I hope this matter will recieve your prompt attention .
For example , if you were hurt seriously like cutting your leg off , the new medical technology could rebuilit part of your body .
Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security carmera which have been combined with mordern technology .
In conculsion , I conciderly said we has been charged by morder technology in two ways .
I am not very good at painting , but I choose it because it is a good oportunity to do it .
I do n't want to dissapoint you , but I am beginner !
In this book , Heathcliff as a child was n't a bad character , but the situations he lived through with the Earnshaw family , where he grew up , made him rude , agresive and noisy .
Before Heathcliff died he riched what he wanted .
In your letter you ask me to choose beetween tents or log cabins . Well I prefer to stay in a log cabin .
It is more confortable and I am afraid of wild animals .
The other activity I like very muche is swimming .
First we had to prapare the stands with food and drink and buy something which had been forgotten .
He is very beatiful !
Fortunatly we had no problem .
I was very proude of myself and the work I had done .
Modern technology has completly changed my daily life , which has become more comfortable , and easier .
Thank you for the exellent programme you have organised for our class .
We would like to inform you that we are all extremly interested in this show and that it could be a great opportunity for us because entrance is free for studends .
We would like to ask if we could go to this show on the 15th March instide of doing the visit to the Science Museum .
Who has never dreamed of being a famous singer , sportman , actor or a politician ?
Firstly , this is because there are a lot of scandale magazine readers .
What a catestrophee !
A desaster !
Also , I used to assist my brother , who is a profecional photographer .
When I read the advertisment for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems .
The advertisment says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them .
The advertisment also says that there are discounts available but this is not true , there were none .
Why do you give this information in an advertisment ?
I have only one question about the baby 's accomodation .
So , you wo n't believe me , but I enjoed helping at an Oasis concert .
Me and my friend were there to hear the sound - check , and when I understood what was happing on the stage , I decided to help them .
Of course you know I 'm a singer , so I came back quigky to my home , I picked up my microphone , and I handed it to the singer .
Can you immagine ?
I will consider taking this complaint to court if I do not receive an acceptable explaination from the theatre .
On the other hand , people in the future will propably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water , the harmful ultra - violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which are the product of a developed and full - grown country .
Therefore , I will suggest that we all nov to keep the enviroment clean and healthy for the next generation .
When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very excited about the idea of seeing it , plus when I heard about the extras that the circle theatre was offering , it became the best oportunity I ever had to attend a musical of that type , but instead of being the best evening I ever had , it was a total disaster and that 's the reason why I am writting to you .
First , the actors that the Circle theatre publis on their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not there , which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions .
Another point that I want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start ( 19:30 ) but it started at 20:15 , so there was major unsatisfaction with that , but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy , and I am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service , and uncomfortable seats .
Science and Technology is a theme very much discussed nowdays , most of the comunity of our city , and of the world , where technology has arrived , confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life .
But not everything about technology and computers is good , because many people , and me in a control way , have become computers ' and thechnologic 's slaves , and we can not do anything without a machine , and I am not saying that it 's wrong or bad , and I accept that they make our daily tasks easier , but we have to mantain our independence as humans .
First of all , there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping , which are that it can be the solvation to our stress and boredom .
Also shopping makes people happier by costing a lot of money and it even influences the economic situation more flexably .
Also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stollen because it is a public place and there are too many people .
In addition , shop owners often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secreatly .
I 'm realy pleased I won your competition !
I 'll give you the nessesserly information about me .
The most suitable time for me is Jule because in August I intend to go to the countryside , where I have a small farm .
You ofer me a lot of activities .
It was absolutlly great !
I gave information about correct ways to other places like tooletes and medical points .
I looked very carefully at the organisation of the event , you know I 'm interestsing in it .
I was so suprise to hear from you .
I was really greatful when I recieved your letter which informed me that I have won first prize in your competition .
Personily I prefer to stay in log cabins because they are much more comfortable than tents .
Unfortunetley I am not good at either of them .
I really hate it , because we 're not allowed to wear casual and fashonable clothes , colourful shoes or colourful socks .
I am very excited and looking forward to the new experiance I am going to have .
I would prefer to stay in tents because I love the atmosephere of camping , but I would n't mind staying in log cabins .
It is based on information made availble by students from each class at school .
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson , because students always make some mistakes while they are practising with thier partner , in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times .
Spending time together out of the class is a nice experiance .
Firstly , I should say that I would like to travel in July because that is the month wich I could most likely have off from work to go on holiday .
That is because , I do not want to seem fuzy , but I like to have some luxuries when I am going on holiday and I think slepping on the floor without electricity may annoy me .
Conversely , painting is an activity wich I have never tryied before , so I have not any skill in drawing but I would like to start doing that now when I have the chance .
On the other hand , I would like to know some imformation wich could be useful on my holiday like : what type of clothes would be more suitable for me in the Camp ?
I am writting to tell you about my experience at the pop concert last month , where I was helping my friend Nick , who was the bouncer at the venue .
My job was to accomodate to the people of the main sit of the theathre .
So , I hope to see you soon to show you all my phothos .
I think it was very clever of me to record that moment wich I will never ever forget , and that was the thing that I liked most about that experience .
I 'm writting to you to make a complaint about your musical show : " Over the Rainbow " ... Last week , I , my husband and our two children went to your theatre to have a good time , but we were so disappointed .
Moreover , there were n't any discounts available like writting in your advertisement .
I will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the maschines wich do the washing and the washing - up , before this , women spent a long time doing these tasks .
I am writing to give you futher information about me which you need for Camp California .
In conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy .
1 . Grammer , which is the basis of learning English .
Speaking : it makes you more confident when you talk with other peoper .
It lets you get more pratices .
Writing . This class techer you how to organise what you want to write .
It is important to pratise your English after lessons .
If you have a problem studing , try asking the teachers about which is the best way to study .
Yours sincerly
I am writing in reply to your letter in wich you told me I won the first prize .
So I want you to send me some money back for that unpleasent night .
The headmaster wanted to tell the police what we had done so we decided to imprison him in a little house we had twenty kilometers away from the village until we could change his mind .
We took some photos of him naked and told him not to tell anybody about this because if he does we will hang the photos all arround the village .
In the following edition the headline was : " Why does a teenager sleep with a toy called Max ? " Everybody laughted at her .
I would like to travel only in July because I will have some hollydays at that time .
3 When you are ready to shopp , sometimes you know beforehand what is your priority , because probaly you need one thing rather than another .
But the best thing that we do , when we go shopp is spend time having lunch at a snack bar , watching movies and playing computer games .
Last month , I worked as a roadie at a Rolling Stones pop concert . I was responsable for the sound .
Some people when they are tired relax by spleeping , reading a book or watching television , but not me .
There are always , at the end of the afternoon , some well - dressed women coming from their offices and they just spend one hour in the shop whithout buying anything .
However , it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable , for example before Christmas or during some special salles .
Secontly , the show began fourty - five minutes late and nobody told me what had happened .
I preferred riding a motorbike with the people who studyied with me in the Institute .
You have a chance to meet people and now you have an opportunaty to select good friends .
I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring , I booked the ticket imagetly .
I belong to the generation who have grown up with a lot of new technolgy .
For example , TV , telephone , micrown etc .
I tought I would never need a mobile phone , but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now I ca n't live without it !
But the invention that I 'm most thankful for is the computor and the Internet !
So , I start every day by swiching on my mobile phone , to see if there are any more SMS messages before I go to the library to check my e - mail and that 's just the beginning of the day ...
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin , because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places , so a tent would be unapropriate for me .
I haven't played golf for a long time , so it will be pleasent to do so .
Yours sincerately ,
The fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin , while I just stood there trying to see what had happened .
When we saw your advertisment for the musical show , over the rainbow , we immediatly decided that this would be a perfect evening out .
Thirdly , in your advertisment it said that discounts would be available , but they were not .
I am therefore asking for compensation for our disappointing evening and hope we can reach a sollution as soon as possible .
I really like Pat , she 's funny , has a good sence of humor and like me she loves to discuss everything .
I have recived your exciting letter , informing me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I much prefer sleeping in tents . It seems more sociable and realy sounds like holydays .
So one week befor the concert I went to " L'Arena " to meet the other worker and receive the instructions .
I 've had the hounour of helping their sound engeineer and branching the cables for microphones , ggitares etc .
We realy started to work like ants the morning befor the show .
It was exciting looking at all three men working together and building a stage , and it was interresting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible .
About two hours befor the beginning of the show , we met the band and recieved tickets to go backstage . That was wonderful , maybe better than the concert itself !
That 's a great experienc !
Apart from this , photography is one of my favorite hobbies and I usually spend nearly all my spare time doing it and of course I have some diplomas as well .
I would like to request some information about accommodation and if you could specifie what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
I feel that this was a good oportunity for me , not only for my professional but also for my personal life .
According to my job , I had to help the teams with the outlights and , of course , it was my first proffesional experience : in the end I felt like one of them , because they were so kind to me , and I could help a lot and I learnt a lot with this project .
I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't have it in a tent .
These are my favorite because they have a lot to do with water , but I like them more than surfing .
I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shops in the center of a big town .
These days people prefere shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centres , because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of money .
There were 963 people at the " Armaggedon " that night !
You must show a great sence of responsibility .
I 'm sure you are jalous now .
Now I am studying and I 'll continue my studies untill the end of June .
I think it 's a very usefull and helpful thing for my health , especially when I do it with pleasure .
The second of my favorit sports is tennis .
I 've played tennis for ten years . I 'm a profesional and I have to be good at it , in any time .
The most enjoable thing was to dress people .
But when we saw our show and heard how loudly the audience claped them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time . You should try it and see .
I would like to stay in a tent because I used to go camping at weekends but if there 's any problem I could be very confortable in a log cabin too .
I have never tried either of them before and as a result I ca n't be good at them but I 've always wanted to sail because I love the sea and now I have the opportunitie .
If you do n't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are apropriate for the camp and for the Californian weather .
First of all , we usually go to the shops at the same time as the rest of the world and that 's a little bit complicated because the shops are full and it 's impossible to try acurately .
I would be greatful if you could send me the full details .
In the following paragraps I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of shopping .
In a suppermarket , shop or department store they have many things .
It is very convenien .
Sometimes , there are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queu .
Most people enjoy shopping because it is more convenien today but if you found a busy place for shopping or it was not as good as you expected .
Dear Sir or Madam , With reference to your advertisment regarding the musical show " Over the rainbow " I am writing to you with the intention of giving you an impression of our experiences attending the above - mentioned show . We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters .
According to your advertisment the play should have started at 19:30 .
What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given ; not even an apologation .
A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught .
Last week I was on holiday in London and I was very dissappointed when I visited your theatre .
First of all , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 , but it was delayed untill 20.15 , and when the show finally began we were supriced to see that Danny Brook , who was the star of the show , was not playing and someone else had replaced him and he was really disappointing .
Anna told her again : " Pat do n't tell anyone please , especially my brother , everything would be ruined then " . And Pat answered : " Do n't wory I wo n't tell anyone " .
The big secret was that Anna was prearing a suprice party for her brother John and she did n't want anyone to know about it .
It will be a pleasure to give you all the information wich you need .
As far as I know accomodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins .
It 's more convinient for me .
I am a good diffender .
I 'd like to know what temperature it will be in July in California and your advice about how much money I will need to have an unforgetable hollydays !
If we decide to buy somthing special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it .
During a prior holiday in London I came across an encouraging advertisment for the show and decided to see it .
Unfortunately , I was very dissappointed to find out that there were no discounts available !
In addition , I was very annoyed by the fact that the event had started at 20:15 - not 19:30 as stated in the advertisment .
I 've always enjoyed danger and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough coockie .
Especially now , when ' big - mouth ' Pat has spread the news to litterally everyone . I would n't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me .
Furthermore , for the activities I want to select Tennis and Basketball because I have been playing tennis since I was young and basketball because I played for the team in my college as the capitan .
Anyway , this was my experience working at the concert . If you have an oportunity to help at any concert you should help because you have a lot of fun as well , OK .
I am writing to you , in reply to the letter I have recently recived , to inform you about some details that I am concerned about .
In your letter you presented the possibility of choosing two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join in with basketball and climbing , as I am very good at both of them because I played basketball in my secondary scholl as captain of the team and due to my long training sessions lifting weights .
There is , as well , the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds , crambled in the small shops during the only day - off you have to buy somthing you like .
All this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown , particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way through the crowds or while you were qeuing to pay .
I 'm the winner of the first prize in your competion and I 'm writing to you to give you some information which was requested by you .
And it 's creating a lot of adict people , called " shopalcoholics " .
I am writting to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre .
He told me that it was nessary to do something about it .
As Pat was lossing his patience , he decided to talk to him .
I can say that I was very nervious and anxious about what was going to happen .
I am writting this letter to informe you about the decisions I have made regarding your questions .
When I was a child I was affraid of all these little insects that live in the ground and this fear still remains now .
I also think that the log cabin will be much more confortable than the tent .
asketball and swimming are the two activities I have chosen .
Finaly I would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the money we will need .
I was only responsable for the property of the back stages .
I was shocked and terrified the firt time I saw them , but the truth is that they are men like us .
They have a very simple life and behavior when they are n't on the stage .
Definetely , it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back .
I recived your letter about the two weeks I won at camp California in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July because I will have holidays in that mounth .
Yours sincerily
Also , we will take the drinks from our canteen and there will be a group of mucisians for our entertainment .
I was surpised because I did not know what he wanted .
When I went he wanted to tell me that from the next month I would be his personal secratary and my salary would be twice what it was previously .
Unfortunatly , the musical show was n't much like that the one the advert had described , and that is why I want to ask you for some money back .
Now I have a new computer , which is very easy to use , and confortable for my fingers and also faster .
And he can ansewer me very quickly .
I think it is now the futur of big companies to work with the Internet .
I am writting to inform you of some problems we had .
We had to wait over 40 minitues
It seemed to sink into the sea , but fourtunately , the storm soon went away .
Finally when it started we noticed to our suprisement that it was not the right actor on stage .
Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasent dinner .
Anyway , we defenately know that they 're going to change .
In the paper it was writting that the principal actor is " Danny Brook " but it was n't him , it was a different actor whom we had never seen , or heard .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , this sentance is very popular in our school .
I helped to guide foreginers who would like to participate in that .
Thank you for your letter . I was so happy to receave such good news that I could n't believe it .
Regarding the accomodation at Camp California , I prefer to rent a tent , which is going to be more fun , I think , but are the tents singles ?
Is there only one teatcher for each sport , and how many are in each group ?
It 's the place where you can meet your friends , where you can talk freely , and there are no teatchers . It could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons .
Finally we should film the lunch , which is also a moment for the students , and for the teachers , to relax . We must n't forget to film the staff room because if a school is made of students , it 's also made of teatchers .
I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competiton for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
First I want to thank you for all the congratulations , and I 'll try to answer all your questions about , for instance , travel and accomodation . I have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July ( because her small children are in summer school at that time .
I was so happy and suprised that first I could not really believe it .
Secondly , regarding the accomodation , I would say I prefer living in a tent rather than in a log cabin because I used to sleep in a tent when I was staying in a local scout camp in my country .
Thirdly , I have choosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favorite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them .
Finally , I would like to ask you whether I have to prepare any speacial clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me .
A group of girls can stay in a shopping center forever .
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased that I won the first prize in your compition .
In addition to all this , I would appriciate it if you could let me have more details about clothes and how much I shall be paid for the trip .
Another reason is that it will be more useful for forigen students who want to speak English .
The number of forigen students has recently been increasing .
To sum up , it is recommened that speaking classes and school trips should be filmed .
First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the oportunity to travel .
You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart , the accomodation I would like to have and so on .
Travelling in July , I have to say , would be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and I wish to spend my birtday in the best way possible , so that means there .
I also would prefer to sleep in tents , which are more comfortable , and , because I have been doing lots of camping , I am quite used to this kind of accomodation .
The activities I have choosen both represent a pation for me .
We are writting to you to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , which we saw last week in your Theatre .
The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30 , but it actually started at 20:15 due to a probleme with the sound .
We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts were n't available for us , because they did n't accept our student indentity cards from Switzerland .
What is the effect it has on your environement ?
The major probleme for the industrial cities is to deal with the bad effects of polution on the environement .
A lot of money is involved in research to stop the increase in levels of polution .
To sum up , all the improvements come at a price : the condition of the environement .
When it was time to take the final exam , she became ill and she could n't do it so the teachers decided to allow her to pass the course because she had a lot of good marks , but on the other hand the principal desagreeded and did n't give permision to pass her .
She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and as is usuall the girls from the last course became popular .
Pat , to win her new classemates ' friendship , told everything that she knew about her friends and , because of what Pat said , her friends ended their friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged .
And it is even more difficul to predict what clothes in the future will look like .
I saw the performance and it was not as it was described in the advertisent I read in the local newspaper .
Then , I was planning to buy three £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were dicounts available but that was not true , so I could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show .
Finally , I was thinking of having dinner in the threatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees .
What was suposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening , resulted in a very disappointing time .
So I would be greatful if you paid for a full refund of the money I spent on the tickets .
Computers , radio , CDs , sattelite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life .
Another advatage is that , for example , sattelite television , which is an example of modern technology , keeps me informed about what is happening in the whole world .
After considering your accomodation offers , I 'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible .
It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast between this and the classroom atmosphear but also show how they are as young people .
On top of everyting , the restaurant which was advertised in the advertisement was closed because it was being arranged .
You can imagine how dissappointed I felt after that evening , and I am writing to ask you for a refund of part of the money .
But , in other things , I think modern technology hasn't changed my way of life too much : I do more or less the same as I did some years ago : I get up in the morning , go to school , have lunch , study and go out with my friends without being afected by microchips or nuclear energy .
I have happily received your reply and I want to thank you for this marvelous prize you have given me .
After helping to do that and many other things , my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day ( the group ) left , they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did , and shoke our hands .
It started at 20:15 leaving us waiting for fourty five minutes .
In the future people will wear clothes made of polyseer and nylon because cotton and wool will be rare and expensive .
Also I think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution - I think there will be many such places in a hundred years - and a hat designed to protect people from the strong sunrays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will do damage to the human skin .
Now , it is already possible to send our shopping list by computer , and this opption , in the next few years , will become the most common one .
The new technologies will probably produce a considerable revolution in some essencial parts of the house .
For example , we will have computerizated ovens , microwaves and freezers , or we will probably have central heating controlled through the Internet from our office .
Firstly , log cabins are more comportable than tents .
Is there a possibility of exchanging different currancies to US dollars ?
When you think of shopping , it reminds you of going out ( mostly ) with friends , looking for new things like clothes , accesoires etc . and buying them .
Then in the adverstisement it said that the performance began at 19.30 .
I was very nervious .
So this evening was terriable .
And now I requere my money back .
Among them , the mobile telephone , computers , telefaxes , different appliances for the kitchen , mashiens which help housekeepers to do any work about the house .
So with the appearance of new morden technology people have got much more free time .
Some years ago people , especially students , had to run to lubraries in order to find a book about something .
I use the Internet very often , and I must say it is very convienient .
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends , or if something terriable has happened to me , I do not have to run somewhere to find a telephone box .
With it people do their work more quikly and successfully .
I saw an advertisement which made it seem very atractive to me .
Firstable , I decided to go see your show to be entertained by the performance of Danny Brook so I was very sad to find another actor on the stage .
It 's enbelievable it was 45 minutes late .
We stayed with a host family in a surburb of the city .
The man said it was OK this time and we got in quite easely , we 'd made it .
I 'm excited to be going on holliday there and , thanks to you , I will realize a dream that I always wanted to do .
Yours faitully
On Monday we could first go to the Sience Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich .
Everone knows you because of the journalists , so you ca n't just ignore them , can you ?
I am writing to you because of the unpleasent evening I have had recently .
Ealyer I had seen an advertisement for the show but the information on it was fals .
The last thing is that it was unpossible to go to the theatre restaurant because it was closed .
I would like to write about how it has influented my daily life .
I am a student at a technical univercity .
When I neaded some information I had to go to the liblary to find it in books or newspapers .
The computer is helpfull when I want to contact somebody very fast .
The second thing is that when I neaded a phone card to call somebody I had to stand in a long queue .
Although we would like to visit the science museum , we can leave it to the next opportunity . What we suggest doing is intead of going to the museum in the morning we go to the Leisure Show and keep the afternoon programme the same .
I knew I could not make any moviment for my safety but I did and to my surprise it ran away .
Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programm of my school , which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July .
Concerning the activities , as a matter of fact tennis is my favorit sport and I am very keen on it . For the second activity I would like to enroll in surfing , because my husband , who is already a proficient surfer , keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport , and I think it is worthwile trying , therefore I 'd love to be in the beginners ' group .
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking , computing , make - up , languages , geographie , to culture and civilization .
Once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life . Depending on their levels of proficiency , they have to study for instance languages wich I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way . Students have to manage to speak at least three languages .
Another important lesson to film is " culture and civilization , " so people will know that the hostessess trained at this school are not simply , as the French say , " pot - au - fleurs " , beautiful faces , but also well - read people .
Last but not least is the class called " know - how " , wich shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are stressed .
To whome it may concern ,
Firstly , the advertisement said that Danny Brook was going to starr in the musical but it turned out to be a completely different person , which was very disappointing .
Secondly , according to the advertisment , the musical was supprsed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15 , which caused me problems .
With all the dissatisfuction above , therefore , I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it should have been .
She saw some familier faces on the other side of the street .
And if it is possible , I would rather be accommadated in log cabins because I would not like to share the bathroom facilities with someone who I do not know well .
I am in the school swimming team and I am intered in photography professionally .
Could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expensise money to spend ?
And what 's more , there were n't any discouts available and the theatre restaurant was closed : the only people who could enter were the actors and the staff .
Well , it seems that it was n't my perfect evening and for all these reasons I demand to have my money back , I wasted £ 20 to see a show which does n't respect the programm I paid for .
Science and technology can be useful : see for example the use of TV in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to get further information about something that intersts you .
Again we 're so sorry that we are causing you inconvience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us .
But we could have everying we want .
Home might be a mixture with moden styles and a natural appearance as well .
These days a lot of contries have been worried about lands that ca n't have enough space to build houses .
Because we are living a computerlised life , we 'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well .
On the other hand , what migh still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home , such as a beautiful garden , a small terrace .
Last week I went to the Circle theatre , for which you are responsable , to se the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I think modern technology has changed mankind 's life a lot , expecially since last century .
The changements brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or without a part of it .
In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity : I live on a little mountain at 160 metres altitud so I can not go to the city using a bycicle . Because of my " isolation " the telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and the Internet to study or do research , because there are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town .
Only those who get good marks can take part in theese activities , so sports activities are seen as a prize , so while the students are playing basketball , tennis , volleyball ... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces , and our volleyball team is excellent .
Be carefull , my own technology can kill me .
The only convinient time to travel is in July .
This part had to be saved for later because the concert orginazer wanted to know the exact number of visitors .
Here , I had to check the bags and couts of the girls .
I think it 's because the last time I travelled ( with my friends ) , we stayed in log cabins , and when I was sleeping I felt something moving on my skin , then I woke up frightened and when I openned my eyes , I saw lots of big ants !
Greatefully
I met all the staff , and Ricky took lots of fotographs with me and gave me an autographied Record .
I am also writting to make a suggestion and to give you my opinion about next year 's festival .
An internation arts festival is a great idea , but at the last die there were stars and artists from only six countries , and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures .
I could not listen to one of my favorite classical concerts , " La Moldava " by Smetana .
In Italy there are n't a lot of rules at school and they are n't very stricht .
I am writing to you in order to describe my last visit to your theater .
Unfortunatly , I am very disappointed about the organisation of your company .
Firsty , the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later .
I do n't know whether it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatrer that it promises much more then the people can get for their money , or whether it was on June 7 ( my visit ) only , but I do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed .
Because people have fast and comfortable cars , they are much more mobil and can spend their free time more aktiv - they can often visit their friends and travel much more .
Secondely , we can do our jobs today more efficiently .
I found your advertisement in the tourist board officis and as the musical " Over the rainbow " seemed to be a good option I chose it .
Lyter a long time walking we decided to return and now the weather was so hot we decided to find a place to drink something .
I 'm really very unlucked .
However , we saw an advertisment for " The London Fashion and Leisure Show " and we would all like to go and see it .
We could immediatly see that it was broken .
All syntetic material will be uncomfortable for these people .
Women will prefere long skirts and short blouses and jackets .
Men will wear as usualy - a suit .
For special ocassions , for example a party , a concert , people will dress very smartly . I think that it will be dresses , and suits swewed by the well - known tailors .
I think that we will observe a few slow changes in fashion , but I hope that new clothes will always be pleasent for people .
As we have seen the advertisment for the programme the school arranged for us as a farewell activity , we are very appreciative and would like to thank you for your kindness , as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class , which we have hardly done at all .
So this is a great oppotunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design , because in this show there will be a fashion show , a demonstation from make - up artists , and a contest for hair stylists .
Furthermore , most of the famouse brand of sportswear companies will be at this exhibition with their new products for the coming season .
Anyway , intstead of going shopping in the afternoon session , we will attend the show .
We all think the programme is organised well . In particular we 're so keen on the idea of going to the National Art Gallery , to see the work of the bigest painters in the world .
I 'm writing to you because we saw a great advetisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really would like to go to see that show .
I think it 's a great opportunity , because we will have a chance to se the latest fashion , leisure and sports wear , and also the way to do the perfect make - up and hairstyl .
In my opinion , we can have a great time there , and entrence is free of charge for students , which is very important as well .
We thought that with that beutiful weather the seeside would be just perfect for relaxation , sunbathing and joy .
However , the truth was a little bit diffrent .
The weather had changed suttendly , and there was no more sun , but strong wind and heavy rain .
Despide that we were still thinking optimisticly .
We were thinking is so many other activites to relax and enjoy ourselves then sunbathing on the beach .
The sky went completly black , so at first it was difficult to see where everybody was .
I looked around and I relised a friend of mine was still in the sea , and fighting against the storm , trying to get to the shore .
Everything was looking so dangerous but fortunetly it ended well .
I would like to apologise to you for my controversary opinnion but I feel really disappointed .
I came to London for a short holiday to meet new poeple and to have a taste of English culture .
I 'd seen your advertisment which recommended the play ' Over the rainbow ' and I liked it very much .
In the advertisment ' DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE ' was written . Shall I ask you one question ? - Why were n't they available ?
Everybody was schocked and I was trying to keep the faith .
Nevertheless , after the show I was very hungry so I went to the theatre restarrant and what did I see ?
Finally - you offered a wonderflul evening but I must say that if I had known that it was going to be like that I would n't have wasted my time .
I feel entitled to write this letter and I feel the oportunity .
Yours faithfuly
The main adventage is that it provides you with all the information that you need .
Furthermore you can play with the computer , and unfortunetly this fact especially has changed my life .
On the other hand , playing games and using a computer widens my brain so , as you can see , this modern staft has got many advantages and disadvantages .
I saw the advertisement for the International Arts Festival wich is a great idea .
Firstly I want to congratualate you on the festival .
I have a suprise for you .
Shopping is not always enjeyable .
Secondly , you have a lot of choises and you do not know what to buy .
Lastly , there is a recyling problem , which many people do not care about .
In my opinion , small shops and the street markets should be supported . On the other hand , the big supermarkets should think more about the recyling problem , which will be the most important problem in the near future .
Secendly , the show started at 20.15 .
I will be gladfull if you will send my money back .
Yours faithfull ,
This was the reason whe we were in horrible trouble with the police .
Let 's go back to the beginig of this story .
There was a secret place where a robber keept gold stolen from a bank .
We found the solution to this deceperous situation - to say nothing to anybody .
Our class really appreciate your preparing this programme , especially with regard to Monday 's atraction .
We are extremaly interested in wisiting London .
In the last edition of ' London 's Guide ' we saw an advert for ' The London Fasion and Leisure Show ' , which will be held on Tuesday and it lasts from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The offer mentions the ' latest fasions ' , which we are incredibly interested in .
Nowedays famous people do n't have an easy life .
They are always attacted by naughty journalists , which have a desire to earn big money for writing an extremaly good report or article .
When chosing this style of life they should realise what their life would be like .
On the other hand , their life has no privaty .
Some people may argue , but I think that politicions and film stars belong to the public .
In conclusion , I belive that we have a right to be informed about their lives , providing that journalists respect some important rules .
We think we 'll have one free hour befor the River trip .
Regarding accomodation , I would prefer to have a log cabin . It would be better to leave money or anything in without worrying about theft . I 've always dreamed about climbing but I have never had the opportunity to try this sport .
I have alredy thought about a change to the programme .
But the worst thing about " London 's newest and best musical show " , as you called it , was the abscentness of Danny Brook .
The actor wich was " dancing " was horrible .
I want you to give me back my money . I hope that in future you will corect all these mistakes .
That was supposed to be a joke from my " coleagues " !
I enjoyied it and here are some feelings and advice for next year .
They do n't fancy going into the crowdy shop .
I recieved your letter congratulating me for having won the first prize in your competition .
I am very greatfull and I want to thank you very much for letting me go on this trip .
They are much more confortable than tents .
Appart from calling them , I also helped build the stage , and took care of the lights .
I can tell you that it was a wonderfull experience .
But Pat , coming back hom , told her mother everything .
The advirtisement I had read did not tally with the performance .
Today it is used practically in all spheres and its influence on people is not unnoticable .
I am writing to tell you that the students of my class have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion And Leisure Show .
I had to become a burgler again and steal jewelry from the jewellers nearby .
As I knew the teknics to break into a place without being noticed , I should not have been afraid but tonight I had to steal the most precious diamond in the country , which was very well protected .
There were laisers all over the place , which I had to be careful of .
I got into the car and gave the jewelry in exchange for my brother , took him and left the place .
The programme offers enjoyment and education , which is esencial for young people .
Secondaly , because we do not have to pay for the tickets .
We have already orgonised our visit in a new programme .
We are looking foraward to hearing from you .
The future is unexpectable and human beings are afriad of dangers , such as tornados or earthquakes .
What we really need in the next millenium is love , that is what will keep all the family together forever .
Life is too short to think about poscesives .
Our houses will change because of new technologe , which may make our lives more comfortable .
What depends on us , is the atmospher we will have in our houses .
The home of the future , for me , is a place of hapinest .
We can not be aware of future technologe , but we might still have some feelings for each other .
I have swimmed since I was in primary school .
In particular , I liked cleaning the stage , because I could stand on a famouse singer 's stage and I could feel his enthusiasm , even though I had to clean it .
I go to the beach almost every weekend to improve my surfing - it is the sport I like best - and I think it would be a nice oportunity to practise surfing too .
There are some things I would like to ask about : the tipe ( and quantity ) of Clothes I will have to take , and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff ( like raincoats ) .
Since we were kids people have told us stories about two sides in conflit : the good and the bad side .
What was more , it was closed because of refurishing .
When I was a university student , I had to find out some imformation for my homework .
I imagined where other contries are like England .
I am still a student and I saw in the advertisment that there were some discounts available .
The first thing I do every day , when I get up , is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffe machine .
All day I speak with the majority of my collegues by telephone or e - mail .
If I haven't enough time to cook I prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave hoven .
The home of the Futere
Technology is changing very fast and at the same time as I 'm writing my article about the future maybe technologists have made a new owen which co - operates with your refrigerator and has a program to make dinner for you every day without you having to do anything .
What about rooms which can sense your mood and act according to that ? If you are tired for example then your stereo might put some relaxing musik on and turn down the light a little bit .
I think that everyone should think not just about the positive side of technologi but also the negative .
First of all , the advertisement I got layed emphasis on Danny Brook 's starring in the show , but actually , a disappointing , unknown actor played his part , and I wonder whether he had real skills .
To make matters worse , not only was the restaurant closed , for no appearant reason , but also the discounts that were said to be available were not .
We are all excited about the programm you 've prepared for us , especially about visiting the National Art gallery .
We have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show in a newspaper .
We think it could be a great opportunity for us because we 'll see the fashion show might shop for leisure and sports wear and all the girls in our class are intrested in new styles in make - up and hairdressing .
A scintist could discover the 4th dimention and we 'd get unlimited space inside the house .
You could tell your wardrobe what clothes you 'd like to wear , your hob will cook your favourite meals and your refigerator will send orders to the supermarkets to buy the food .
I AM WRITIN TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU .
I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW THANFUL I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE .
I HAVE CHOOSEN THOSE BECAUSE I AM QUITE GOOD AT PLAYING BASKETBALL AND I SING EVERY WEEKEND IN THE CHOIR OF THE LOCAL CHURCH AS WELL .
I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL MY QUARIES .
THANKS FOR THE KIND LETTER YOU SENT ME LAS WEEK .
BUT TO MAKE THE THING BETTER I WAS CHOOSEN TO HELP THE BAND AND THE ORGANISERS OF THE CONCERT .
AS YOU KNOW , I AM A SOUND TECHNICH , SO I HELPED THEM TO SET UP THE SOUND EQUIPMENT AND THE INSTRUMENTS PROPERLY .
I am writting to you in order to get my money back , concerning the musical show : OVER THE RAINBOW .
First of all : the actors who were mentionned in the advert are not the same as the ones on stage .
Or special flying shoes , and maybe you would have a screen on your watch to watch your favorite soap operas .
It could be any day but please let me know nearner the time .
I reciently was in London , staying in my sister 's home , and I went to se " Over the Rainbow " .
Sorry , but none of this is proffesional , and I am going to make a demand exactly because you do n't have that , if you do n't give me my money back .
But there was a little problem and it was that my parents did n't let me go to discos alone , so I had to go illegaly , and I decided I would do it .
To sumarize the night , I am going steady with him , and he took me home .
All the truth was then told , and now I am grownded for life .
She defintevely does n't know how to keep secrets .
I want to know if I can take my celular phone , too .
To Mr. Smith , Circle Theater 's manager
We had preparred this quite a long time ago , this trip to the capital and saved a lot of money as well .
When we saw your leaflet that mentionned " London 's newest and best musical show " , we were so enthusiastic and curious that we immediately bought the tickets .
First of all , I think we should consider the way people are dressing at present to see how it 's going to be developped in the future .
In 100 years , it 's possible that everyone will developp his own style using all the new materials like plastic , latex , everything possible , as a way to create their own clothes .
Finally , life in France is crasy , this is the tradition .
I am writting to complain because I was really disappointed by your musical show , which is " Over the Rainbow " , last week .
First of all , the advertising shown us starring , which is Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . However , when I saw it , the musical starred completely diffarent actors . I was really disappointed about it .
Now then , how was this advertising , it was completely diffarent . I am really disappointed with your musical . I am asking you for my money back , because I did n't enjoy your musical .
I am writting a composition about " How modern technology has changed your daily life " . This is our subject .
This modern techonology gets closer between person to another person , get close between worldwide , so that , this modern technology changed our daily life so diffarent .
First of all I would like to travel only in July because I am going to work in Aougust to earn money and after that ( from September to June ) I go to university as usual .
About accomodation at Camp California , I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer to nature .
That show was n't what it was supposed to be and it is for that reason that I am writting to you .
I am writting to ask for the refund of the £ 55 which I spent on the ticket for that miserable show .
All the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with their difficult tascs .
Going shopping is a good thing when you do n't know what else to do but it also has many disavantages .
I am writting to complain about the musical show at the Circle Theatre .
By using a car I not only get an easy way to move around , but I also destroy the enviroment .
For instance with the arrival of the Internet , the new digital television and the researchers in medecin , we are discovering how we can change our lives with only the press of a botton , or look for something new by only thinking about it ... we realize that the new technology has just begun to advance , and it is likely in a few years we will be very avanced in this way .
In my opinion the new techincs have more advantages than disadvantages . My reasons for saying this are that we can live better , we also have more ways of knowing now to live healthily and how to spend our free time .
As you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones I want to do , but I dicided to take swimming and photography , because I am very good at swimming and because I am currently attending a photography course in Vienna .
There was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was OK , because there really were thousends of people .
Edi Vedder even talked to me about their programms !
My golf teacher is my father and I 've only played in a practicing centre , but my father and his friends say I have good talent for golf .
Firstly , we should defnitely put the news review lesson in , because we start every morning with that class and it is where we have a lot of discussion .
I think , nextly we can film either the development class or the society class , because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class .
Secondly time starts at 19:30 on the leafet but it actually started at 20:15 .
Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was colsed because your excuse of being used at that moment .
It said in the leafet that this would be a perfect evening out , while it was not that at all .
She was so frightened and sad that she had no energry .
Fathermore , no discounts were available .
You have a responsoiblity to the audiences .
These things are very convinience ; on the other hand , there are lots of disadvantages .
Unfourtunately it is not so cheap .
I was very serpride when I got the letter from you .
And you need some imformation from me .
I would love to try surfing because it is a very interessting sport and uses a lot of power and enigy so now is the end of the letter .
And I want to know more about the money . Can you give me more imformation about the money that I need to bring whith me ?
Now let 's start whith shopping at the Beverley Center .
The Beverley Center area is the place that the teenagers like to go shopping at the most .
Because everyone has different thinking like Beverley Centre if you go there every day or every week for shopping you will get very bored because sometimes there are too many people everywhere , like in the resturant and shops .
Because all the smells in the market are awful - there is the smell of the meat and durty water , black and smely water , all over the market street .
We hope to see you at the party and have a wonderfull time together .
It means swimming at the wonderfull beaches , tasting the delicious food and having a wonderful time every day and every night with your friends .
I am writing to complain about the musical , OVER THE RAINBOW , and also about the servic .
Sacondly , in your advertisement I had read " Times 14.30 and 19.30 " .
I look farward to hearing from you in the very near future , to offer me my money back .
After that a being climed out of the potato .
I could not belive my ears .
The being moved its hand farward and .....
Immediantely after I heard , " And do n't forget your homework " .
Moreover there will be a demostration of modern make - up and new different , shaking hairstyles .
I look foward to hearing from you in the near future .
The wind was blowing and the heavy rain was drumming agaist our bedroom window .
As a postman , Peter had to deliver letters aroud our little village .
Recently , I had the oportunity to go to your Circle Theatre event .
Unfortunatly I never thought it could be so dissapointing .
The first problem happened at the box office because there were abosolutly no discounts available .
Because of all this , what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definatly one of the worst .
Techology is always getting better .
And it is responsable for many changes in my life , and I think I would n't be able to live without it anymore .
Nowadays , with the Internet it has become easier to do school work and I also like to chat with other people or maybe read the latest news about my favorite football team .
I also recently got a celular phone and I do n't know how I lived so long without one - because it helps to solve problems so quickly , it 's really amazing .
But for me , the best thing is definatly the microwaver .
There are some of the devices of modern techonologys that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me .
Lastly , can you please tell me how much money would be appropiet to take ?
At the end of the concert , when it was after midnight and everyone had alread left , the group came up to each of us ( who helped out ) and thanked us personally !
Now I have the opurtuanity so I shall inform you fully .
The oppurnity of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance .
She is a very nice person . I managed to scavange an authograph for you as well , I will put it in the envelope .
I am looking forward to receiving your answer and do n't forget that it is a surprice birthday party .
In spide of that fact there are of course many families especialy in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together .
And the difference is that those children are effectivily when they grow up and want to have a family , they do the same as their parents and have a happy family .
Besides that the most importand thing is that these children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got pshycological problems and they are useful in sociaty .
To sum up , family life is the most important thing for children 's phycological world which helps them in their education , job and their marriage in future .
I'M WRITTING THIS LETTER BECAUSE TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS IN LONDON AND I WENT TO THE THEATRE TO SEE YOUR MUSICAL SHOW . AND THROUGH SEEING IT MY FAMILY HAD A VERY DISAPPOINTING EVENING AND SO DID I . YOU CAN READ BELOW MY POINT OF VIEW REGARDING THIS .
FIRST OF ALL , WE COULDN'T SEE THE FAMOUS ACTOR " DANNY BROOK " BECAUS HE WAS ILL . I THINK THAT THE MUSICAL SHOW SHOULD HAVE BEEN CANCELLED FOR THIS ALONE .
NOWDAYS THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVE A COMPUTER IN THEIR HOME AND SOMETIMES WE ASK OURSELVES IF MODERN TECHNOLOGY WILL CHANGE OUR DAILY LIFE .
About accomodation I would prefer a cabin , because I suffer from alergic , and I think a tent would not be very suitable for my health .
I won last summer 's swimming competition in the school . Although I 'm not very good at surfing I like it , and I always practis on my holidays every year .
I would like to know if it is necesary for me to bring some money , and if we will have time to visit the City . About the clothes , do I have to bring some winter clothes ?
I 'm very greatful to hear from you .
You asked me to tell you about my experience helping at the concencert last week .
I was asked to put all the chairs in order for the singer . This was only in the beginning . After that I needed to check all the microfons .
After that all the singers arrived and I was in charche of greeting them and giving them something to drink .
You can immagine how excited I was , especially because I always wanted some photographs of them and this was a special moment and I realice I had n't brought my camera . I was very sad .
Actually this was because most things I saw were differend from what the advertisement said .
Unfortunatly , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
One day , we went to a party , where she met some of the most pobular girls in the school .
Afterwards , when I saw her , she laught at me and the next day all the school knew everything about me .
I would like to have accomodation in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent .
So as we can see - shopping is not always enjoable .
About the accomodations , I would rather stay in a log cabin .
For weeks I 'd been planning to go to the threatre with some close relatives and friends but the problems that we had made this perfect night a disaster for all of us .
To begin with , in your advertisment you say that Danny Brooks will be starring in the show but instead there was a different actor , which made us very disappointed .
Another thing that is said in the advertisment is that the evening show will start at 7:30 but there was a forty - five minute delay . The crowd got really upset and we were going to leave at the first chanse we got .
If you do n't do as I say , an article in the biggest newspaper will deffenetly change your ming .
This is something that has trabled many people , especially those who work in the fashion industry .
Fashion has made great progress since the ealary days .
In the early 90s it was in fashing for women to wear only skirts .
Nowdays women wear really short skirts , short t - shirts , short tops , and cut their hair short just like men .
Boys pearce their bodies just like girls do and vice versa .
People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers designe but no one wears .
I took the dissision to write to you because I would like to complaine about your theatre .
I am writing to you because last night I expected to have a wonderful evening and unfortunatly I was very disappointed .
I and some friends disided to go to the theatre to see a musical show .
We were so excitment .
We are on holiday and we desited to go .
We had never been to a musical show and we thought that it was a nowe oportunite .
I believe that some ather actors mabe made the whole story more interesting .
The first was very early , at 2:30 , and the ather at 7:30 .
We went at 7:30 . Finally the musical show stard at 8:15 .
We wate one hour .
When the show finished , we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who whork ther do n't wark if they do n't get their pay first .
I and my friends would be abrisled if you would give us back some of the money we paid .
Humans have done many things Throu the years and made many things possible .
Now we are in the 20th centure in which people have been to the moun and discavered medicines for serious illneses . I live in that century too .
I believe that I am like that , I belong to that centure .
I believe modern techonology has changed everyone , especiale now with computers and all the athers machins .
First I want to talk about the combuter .
Before , I used some ather ways to get information or play or comunicate with people .
I can spend so many hours because day by day I discavered new things .
Maby it is not good because you do n't have the oportunite to meet people and talk face - to - face . Apart from computers we have the telephone , TV , and gyms .
About the TV . I spend many hours in front of the TV . It helps me to relaxe and spend some hours alone .
Exactly happend and with telephone .
About the gyms , I like them very much . Those places have so many machines that you can eazy lose weight and develop a wonderful body .
Now , in conclution we can see , or I can see , that mapy I am not a very sociaple person but I can do whatever I want and take whatever I want only throu technology .
Firstly , I was disapointed , because the actor Danny Brook did not appear in the show .
I am writting to complain about what it says in the advertisement is not true .
3 You recommended the resturant after the show .
It would be greatful if you considered returning my money as soon as possible .
This is not nomally what people wear every day .
The 2nd F is ' fulfill ' wear ever you have in your mom 's cupboard .
For example long baggy troossers , which cover your bright brick shoes .
Wherever you go everyone would love you because of your troussers , which would clean away all the rubbish that is on the road .
If I can choose my accomodation , I prefer staying in a tent .
I prefer this accomodation because I think it 's easier to meet people when you stay in a tent , near them , than when you stay in a log cabin .
TO ANSWER YOUR NEXT QUESTION , I WOULD RATHER STAY IN A LOG CABIN . THE THING IS , I HAVE A FOBIA ABOUT INSECTS AND MY DOCTOR RECOMENDED THAT I SHOULD SLEEP IN AN ENCLOSED AREA .
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF IT 'S NECESARY TO TAKE MONEY , FOOD AND CLOTHES WITH ME .
NOW THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THIS YEAR TO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT THE BEST LESSONS AND ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAVE IN SCHOOL , EVERYTHING POSIBLE OF COURSE WITH HELP OF TEACHER MS . WESTBROOK .
IT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS VIDEO THAT THEY SHOULD FOUCOSED ON OUR WRITING AND CULTURS LESSONS .
FOR CULTUR LESSONS WE DON'T NEED TO GO SO FAR BACK IN TIME ; FOR THE LAST 60 YEARS OUR CULTURE HAS BEEN CHANGING ENORMOUSLY AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT COMPUTERS , WARS , CARS , WEAPONS , ETC ....
ALTHOUG LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T BELIVE IT ,
OUR SCHOOL HAS A SPORTING IMAGE . I THINK THE VIDEO WOULD ENCOURGE STUDENTS TO DO SPORTS AND BE GOOD ATHLETS .
I have received a letter from you saing that I have won the first prize in your competition and you need some information from me .
I would like to travel in July because my hollydays are only in that month and the wheather in California is better then .
They liked me so much and invited me to be responsable for the lights and sound .
I told them that I will think about it but I belive I will accept the job .
The most increible part was the laser show .
They were drowing a lot of things in the sky during the concert .
I 'm shure that you are going to love it .
About my acommodations at the camp , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it 's safer than being in a tent and because you sleep more confortable .
The activities that I would like to do are singing , because my friend told me that I 'm good at it , and the other activitie that I would like to do is climbing because I think it is very exciting although I have never tried climbing , because there are no mountains in my city .
I appreciate the opportuniti that you are giving me and I 'm very grateful to you guys .
Well on march 11th there was a group here in brazil called " Los Jagoares " , they sing pop music . And they are one of my favorites and as you know I have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favorite band was coming he called me and asked me if I would like to help them to install the speakers , microphones etc ... and I said , " Sure man . "
Last Sanday my friends and I saw that advertisement about the play you were supposed to put on .
We waited ther for forty - five minutes for it to start !
We really got bored , like all the other peaple there .
And then delate forty - five minuites to present the show .
That was very disapponted .
My friends and I demand our money bacck very soon .
And please do not be very suprised if you recieve more letters about this .
Pat , my sister and I felt very rensposible .
I did n't beleive him at first .
But I could se that his face was happy and he was n't telling lies .
I could n't beleive it . I had not seen him for five years .
How are you ? I 'm not so well , and that 's the reason why I 'm writting this letter to you .
Unfortunatly your advertisment said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later .
Children are not studying as much as they ought to , because they are watching TV , speacing on the phone or even playing computer games .
This is also another cause of heart attacts .
Your advertisement for the musical Over the rainbow said it was London 's newest and best musical show . I agree with that because it is a wonderfull show but it said that Danny Brook would be starring in it .
In the advertisment it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show , and that is what I did , but when I got there it was shut for no reason .
Pat could n't resist and told her brother Jacob . He was quite shocked about the news because he missunderstood .
There , Jacob aproaches him slowly and tells him .
It was all a missunderstanding .
I hope all my wishes are realizeable .
I can not bear it when somebody says something and then does just the opposit .
It must be our decission whether to stay and eat there , or not .
To cut a long story short , because of everything I have said above , the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my money back , and for you it is just to give it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointings you have made me suffer .
HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAYLY LIVES ?
In our grandparents ' time life was so different that we can not beleive that this huge change to our daily life happened in only one hundred years or less .
Furthermore , as we all know , daily life nowadays is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks ( as our grandparents used to do ) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder .
Strange as it seems , we now have all types of machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less stressful .
I am writing to thank you for notifying me about the competition and I would be very grateful to give to you the information that was requiered in your letter .
About the Accommodation , I would like you to take careful consideration of the fact that I am ashmatic , so I would appreciatte it if you could reserve a bed in a log cabin .
If you have this oportunitty one day , you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like this just to get a free pass .
If this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened , but I had to wait stil quarter past eight to watch the show , instead of it beggining at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement .
As a conclution to that horrible evening I decided to visit your theatre restaurant once the show had finished , but what a surprise when I found it closed .
It consisted in having to memorisize a whole book of 250 pages in order to pass a final exam .
On the exam day everybody anwered every question correctly .
Secondly , although the log cabins appeal to me , I would prefer a tent because I think it is more comfortable and atractive .
Nowadays most people are atractted to shopping centers , which are not always enjoyable .
Forthly , that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy too many things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by yourself .
First of all , the show was suppossed to start at 19.30 , but it started at 20.15 .
I am looking foward to hearing from you .
Nowadays , there are more and more people who want to become designers and the competion is increasing .
I always wanted to go and se the USA !
In my opinion , staying in tents is mor exciting than staying in log cabins .
I 'm very happy about this because I spent most of my scholl life playing sports , especially basketball .
They mixed up our traditonal music and pop music .
In reply to your letter recieved on the 13th of June , I first would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me to have been chosen .
In fact there would be only one possibility in July because I will finish my exams at the end of that month and beginn vocational trainning the 1st of August .
Then , during the concert , I helped to serve the beers at the bar . I met a lot of interresting people while I was serving drinks .
Everything was very interresting , but what I particularly liked about the experience was the human relations .
I met a lot of different people and they all taught me something new about behaviour or compation .
I prefer to stay in a tent so I go campping every summer and am used to sleeping in tents .
I 'm very good at swimming as I have been a member of various swimming clubs since I was 6 and I chose photograthy because I have a new camera and want somebody to teach me how to use it .
Introduction : To support an idea to make a short video about daily life at our school I have spent some time discussing it with other students , and observing and analaising an avrege day in our scholl and have come up with some suggestions .
I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as the anual sports turnament or wellcoming evening for new students .
Conclugen : To sum up the above I 'd like to suggest not filming anything longer than 1 or 2 minutes and having a nice mixture of places , faces and events .
First of all , on the ticket it says that the actor was Danny Brook and realy he was not .
Then , on the ticket it says that the show starts at 19.30 and , I do n't know why , it started at 20:15 , very unpolited on your part , and , also , you wasted my time .
The other thing is that on the ticket it apears that discounts were available but when I asked about it , there were none .
I thought you were a good theatre , where people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else , but realy I am very disappointed and I want to ask for my money back .
I 'll never return because of the bad service you ofer .
Truely .
Considering my whole life I can say that moden technology has changed my daily life in many ways .
It has , in some way , separated the family , making all of us worried about ower own things .
We all work separately , developing individually and forgoten we have to all talk together to know about each other 's life .
First of all , we went to the theather to pick up our tickets .
We sat in our seats and waited for the show but it did n't start on time , it started at 20.15 which was a redicoulus time .
They are just wersting time on it .
Both of them I am not as good as you expect , but recently I have been intrested in them .
Howeve , we decided to have the job , because of good money .
Howeve , it was a great job . I haven't hade such a great experience before .
I was very disapointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true .
I think it will be a very good experience for me . I 'm realy excited about it .
I 'd love to come earlier , but I realy ca n't because this job is very important to me , and I 'll need it as work experience for my further studies at University .
I would also appreciate it if you would offer me accomodation in a log cabin , because of some health problems that I have , which do not allow me to sleep outsid on the ground , and to be honest with you , I never liked camping .
At the end I feel very tired and angry , because I have spent the whole morning doing nothing , except for looking at them trying on diferent clothes , and that 's not enjoyable at all , in fact it 's realy annoying .
To let you arrange the details of your programe , I 'm going to give you my answers .
Firstly , I 'd like to travel in July because I 've already resistered on another summer course which starts at the end of July .
About accomodation , I prefer tents to log cabins .
Actually I 've been in an amature photographer 's organization for 3 years .
At that time , I took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strocks .
And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need excluding transport and accomodation .
Concerning the accomodation , I prefer to stay in log cabins , finding them much more comfortable than tents !
Last week during my holiday in London , I found your advertisment in my newspaper .
You stated in your advertisment that he would come on stage , but instead of him someone else turned up .
Luckely I could keep my secret for a couple of days but then it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to .
I 'm looking forward to learning how to take care of myself in dangerous situations , such as getting lost in a forest , and I think staying in a tent will be very usefull for that .
This is something I will never ever foget .
I could n't believe that I had met that superstar who was dancing in front of a crouded soccer stadium .
Unfortunalety my feelings are rather bad .
The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I dicided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show .
The ' theatre ' did not even appologize for this change .
Despite my being a student and the advertisement saying that discounts were available , I was refused a half - price ticket , and the explaination ' why ' was n't sufficiant .
Unfortunately it was not , which made me even angier .
Saturday morning I went to the driving center for my first lesson .
The instractur opened the car door and asked me to sit in the driver 's seat .
Then I drove very slowly very ofen crossing the white line on the road .
I looked in the mirror and I saw how my friends were lauthing .
Pat appologized to me for not keeping my secrets .
An admiree
I am writing to inform you about the differences between your advertisment and the real show .
Then , as we were told that the show was begginning , the second shock of the evening faced us .
Maria spent all day thinking about who told them that . There were two posibilities : one , her best friend Becca , or her sister Pat .
Obviously , Pat first denied it , but then she accepted that she was wrong , and apologyse to Maria . After that Pat never again talked about anyone without his or her permission .
It is your desicion .
I would like to send you some futher information which you need .
I am greatful that I have the chance to choose the accomodation . I would rather stay in a tent if it 's not a problem for you .
I would like to experience a reall camp again .
I would like to thank you onc again for this great opportiunity .
We would like to belive that shopping is the most wonderful part of our life .
When we finally do this , we can not be confortable because of the crowds .
The answer is that we choose the same street ( usually the most popular ) and the same time as six hundrets other people .
I am writting to you to give you my opinion about your festival .
To conclude , I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at a reasonally price , because for someone who does not especially like art , it was very attractive .
I am writting to you to answer your question about school rules and what I am ( and I am not ) allowed to do at home .
In my home , the only things I am not allowed to do are things which might disturbe my familly .
For example , putting the music on too loud when my syster is working .
I believe that it was a great idea to organise such a festivel , connected with art and culture .
What is more , there was a wide vareiety of music . Although the artists were supposed to be from all countries , there were only six nationalities .
However I was really suprised that the entrence fee was so low .
I hope that this will claryfy your questions and doubts .
I 'm looking foreward to hearing from you .
I am writting this letter because I am very dissapointed with your musical show .
When we arrived , there were a lot of people , the place was beatiful , all seemed perfect .
After that they changed the principal actor , the one that replaced him was very bad , that made us realy angry .
How has moden technology changed my daily life ? I think that technology has changed my life and everybody 's life in many ways .
Nowadays , technology is everywhere , all over your house , your school , ofice or any place you can be in a city .
This technology has helped to make my life easier and more exciting , but like everithing it has had some negative aspects .
This technology has helped in many fields , like medicine , entreteinment , work and other things , so it has obviusly changed the lives of many people .
The bad consequences that this could have are unimportan , in comperison with all the good things it has done , so let 's not focus on the negative aspects of it .
This is a new era , an era for a new tipe of people , the feuta people
Secondly the time on the leaflet is totaly wrong .
Thirdly the ticket was not discount and after the show I visited the theater restaurant but it was closed because the show started late .
Finaly last night was not a perfect evening .
But when I hear the word future , I have an image of metalic colours so that in my imagination they are wearing metalic or brightly coloured clothes .
I think people will wear clothes which are metalic or bright colourful colour with mixture of history and future fashion style in the future .
Firstly , I must say that I 'll be able to have two weeks free only in July , since I have started work and am intitled to have a holiday only in July .
Despite my appriciation of all kinds of sports and activities , I 've chosen my favourite ones , which are swimming and tennis .
Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assisstants try to sell any product to the " victim " coming through the door .
Our department , which is the sales department , have to make good sales results befor the end of June because of the financial month .
About accomodation , I prefer to stay in log cabins because I do n't like to stay in tents which are unconfortable for me .
In Japan , I often play Golf but as you know Japanese weather conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing Golf , but California has good weather , which means sunshine every day , hopefuly .
I am interst in playing tennis very much .
Finaly , I have some questions .
So , my templary job was sound engineer but I was not main engineer .
When I was a university student , I studied sound effects , but I had n't used effect equepument my whole life because our school does n't have it .
I used this equepument during the concert , but I was so compricate system .
They taught me paticulaly .
Take care of youself .
Hellow ! I am very pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition and I want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your Camp in July because that month I usually have a rest and now I am thinking about it .
To answer our first question about where I would prefer to sleep , I prefer tents because they are closer to nature and I like sleepping in sleepping bags ( = BV bags ) .
Now let me tell you about my sports preferances .
Yours scinerly
In our school we have a listem of " double lessons " .
It means that every day exept Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for an hour and a half and it means a " double lesson " .
I think that is more convinient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts forty - five minutes .
It is convinient , I mean " double " lessons , because you have more time to understand the matherial which is givven out and because you have to prepare only four subjects for " tomorrow " and it is fewer then seven subjects .
On Tuesday we have these lessons : English , Maths , Economics and Phisics .
Not only these subjects are studied by us , but also Latin , Russian , Ukrainian , Biology and Phisical training , but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects .
I have always been interesed in arts and festivals .
It was great that you organised the Arts Festival in this city , because people realy need this kind of sochibal activity here .
I spent two days at the International Arts Festival with some of my friends and I must say we were realy delighted , it was a great idea to do that in London .
I hope you will concider my opinions and that my suggestions will be helpful for next year .
When I groue up I 'll change all the rules in my life and I 'll make my own rules which are not going to be too strict .
( It is a graduate engineering school where we are studying mecanics and energetics . )
That is why we have to single out wich lessons and other activities should be filmed .
Secondly , we should interview the teacher of heat transfert since his lessons are really breathtaking .
On the other hand , we should be interested in the other activities such as sports , wich could appeal to more students in our school .
To make matters worse , we have never had the oppurtunity to see Danny Brook because , instead , there was a different actor !
You wrote so persuately that it would be our " Perfect Evening Out " ...
I hope you will agree and share my disappointement .
Sincerly yours ,
In fact , winterseason will be rare or will maybe even disappear .
The ice will smellt , the weather will be warmer .
People wo n't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certenly be sinthetic , because there wo n't be enough places to cultivite cotton and to let sheep graze .
Our feelings will be transmitted electronical through our clothes to other people .
" The Internet on our body " .. I 'm shure that is not impossible !
I am writing to you with a request for a change in the scedule of our trip to London .
Unfortunatly I have to suggest a change for the programme for Tuesday the 14th of March .
All of the students - including myself - think of this as a great opportunity that it would be a pitty to miss , especially when students can enter for free .
I 've always wanted to taste the freedom that birds have , always been interested in listening to my blood pumpping in my vains , full of adrenaline , to let myself free , to shake from excitement .
The home of the future will be very impersonal and the atmosfear will be cold and very essencial .
I think this tendancy will become more common in the future .
What is important is not their fashion but their knowledge , attitude to everthing including fashion .
I apologise For any incovenience and I am waiting for your reply .
Last week I recived your letter in wich you told me that I won first prize .
I am writting in response to it .
Please , when you recive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything .
We are going to make a video about daily life at school . The following classes are the ones I recomend filming .
ENGLISH : the classroom is beautifull , and on the same day we do a lot of diferents activities , so it wo n't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there .
Those three classes are my choises . I hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school .
Finaly , I would like to ask you for £ 20 back as I was not satisfied with your services .
But Pat could not resist the temptention to call the police .
I am not used to sleeping in a tent and I think it might ruen my holiday . I hope it 's possible to sleep in a log cabin but if it 's not , you can also put me in a tent .
Surfing is my passion . I live near a beach and whenever I have the time I grab my bord and go surfing .
I am realy looking forward to this holiday .
The realy thing was that I had to look after them because without me they would have been lost .
The thing I realy liked was helping the artists and talking to them .
I realy got to know them after the concert .
Mabey next time you can come with me . That would be a lot of fun .
Finaly , I did n't understand why you pushed people to visit your restaurant if you do n't open it after the show !
If I want to discuss something with friends or order a Pizza , I can do it as easely as I want , when I want .
A good example is the celular phone . I can contact my family without any problem , I can inform my company if I have an accident in my car .
To sum up , although I think they ought to abondone their lives partly when they entre the world of fame , they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights .
An actor was changed and the pubblic were not informated .
Finally , the theatre resturant was closed for the holiday !
I think modern tecnology is very important in my life .
I also think I am lucky , because I live in a period of tecnologic boom .
In the last fifty years human tecnologies have grown exponensially .
First the conquist of space , then computers , and now the new biotecnologies have changed , and are changing , the face of the world .
In the present day , for ecsample , a lot of people have a personal computer at home , and a very large proportion of those also have the Internet , the new frontier of computer evolution .
If I look back to the past I find that the computer is following the same route as television , the telephon and a lot of other things that now the largest part of the population have at home .
So , in my opinion , new tecnology has changed , is changing and will change my daily life ; I hope that afterwards my life will be better .
The whole class and I would like to thank you for the good programm which you have organised for our trip to London .
The reason why I 'm writting to you is the class and I have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday , March 14 from 10.00 am - 7.00 p.m.
We all are interested in fashion and hairstyles and it is a great oppurtunity for us because students do not have to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour .
I would like to suggest to you how the programm could be changed .
Instead of a shopping tour on Tuesday afternoon , we could go to the show and do the shopping on Wedensday afternoon in our free time .
What do you think about this suggesten ?
I hope you will unterstand this kind of matter . The class and I are looking forward to hearing from you .
That means for exampel , while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll your home with the computer . You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off .
Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk , eggs or chees .
Or , without leaving the office , you are able to heat the wather for a hot bath .
So in fact people 's homes will become more confienence and more comfortable .
I think also housewives will receive more help with a robotor in the home .
As representant of my class may I kindly ask you to partially change your plan for our visit to London ?
It would be beutiful if you would agree to change your plan .
It happened on a very lovly day in summer .
I knew I could n't swimm so I realized it might be dangerous for me as well .
The most important thing was a little boy of about ten years old , who was in the watter without his parents and could n't swimm .
It was diffucult for me because I am afraid of watter .
He was exhaused and could n't breathe .
I am a good swimmer and I have some expirience in photography . However , I have a lot to learn .
Actually , the price of the weekend ticket was excellent ! I , myself , was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificient events .
Well , I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate you on the great sucess of the festival .
I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an allergie to grass .
If you have to go shopping again , because the fridge is empty or you need some new clothes , a lot of time , patience and straingth are needed .
So even if it 's nice to have food or new clothes at home , without patience , time and straingth you had better stay at home or try to find the most convenient time for shopping .
2 Desember , 2000
I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added to next year 's International Arts Festival , wich in my opinion has been a great idea .
Although I read that stars and artists came frome around the world , I realised that they only came from six countries .
All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much , but I personaly think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films .
The rest of the activities were very interesting for us , we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people , and all of this without being expensive . I think that the ticket was exellent for us because of its price .
You know that I 'm studing in a difficult school , and as you can imagine you have to work hard and you have to do homework every day .
I have friends that are studing in other schools and they are very happy with their freedom .
It is true , they deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time , however this publicity brings them money , and a confortable life .
They can travel around the world , buy everything , it is a good life , but at the same time , they must be very good peaple , because " Fame " is just for a short time , nothing lasts forever in this world .
I would not really like to be a famous person , because you are not really yourselfh , and for me that is the most important thing .
The first thing that dissapoint me was the star .
but the reastaurant was closed because the show started at 20:15 and finissed at 00.15 and the restaurant was open until 00.00 .
After all these problems I became dissappointed .
If you could give me some of my money back that would be a great apology for the waste of time and my dissopointness .
It was about Marine , who was our clase friend .
Marine 's real father wanted her back but the other cuples did n't want to give her back because they loved Marine so much .
The cuples could n't tell the truth to Marine because they were afraid of losing her .
I was greatful to hear I have won first prize in the competition .
That 's why I 'd like to feel adventurally .
And according to the interviews , the most interesting class is the " upper intermidiate " class .
The point of " upper intermidiate class " .
Yesterday morning , I went to the toilet . I overherd two people talking about my son . I felt sorry for myself and I burst into tears . I quickly got out of the toilet .
" Dear " menager of the Circle theatre ,
I was getting angry , but , finally , the show started and I became quiter .
In the end , I asked for I money back ( and paiment for my orrible night ) : do you think anybody will give me something back ? !
Science and technology characterize our moder society .
Walking on a city street , it 's difficult to find parks or " green " places with trees and clean air : actually pollution , traffic and noize are the main problems of our society .
I know I 'm a " daughter of this techological world " and unluckly I think I could n't live without it : it 's rather strange that today there 's still somebody without a phone , dishwasher , TV ... But , sometimes I ask myself if the " ancient world " , without science , technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one .
It sounds very promissing .
I could feel every movement which was caused by clowds or wind .
I 'm pleaseant to win the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I 'd like a log cabin for my accomodation , because it 's safer and cleaner than a tent and I would n't share it with anyone .
We can analize when shopping is enjoyable , and when it is not .
Buying coffins and graveyard plots to bury relatieves is not as enjoyable as buying clothes .
The rules in Poland are quite similar to those discribed in your letter .
I 'm a student from St. Petersburg , and I 'm studing in a drama acodimy .
My freind & came to London for an excursion .
Danny Brook is my favorit actor & to see him was my dream since my childhood !
It was a suprise when we were told there would be another actor .
Also , we expected to get a discount as students , but international students cards are not valid in your theater ( that is very strange - even your advertisment has information about discounts ) .
So we were late for our supper in the hotel and the theatre restaurant was also closed without any risons given .
In the advertisment it said , , your perfect evening out ! " , but it was n't .
I 'm waiting for your anser and hope I can get my money back !
I would call our days days of great technologycal progress .
Industrial weel going faster and faster .
They have more differet functions and forms .
It is very intresting for me how new works , their possiblyties .
My job , I think is a good way to get a profesion in the future .
And I hope to find a realy good job in a good company .
More and more people buy mobile phones , because they are very usefull , you get a lot of possiblyties like : using the Internet , buying different goods , booking tickets , controlling your home technic and many authers .
Mobile communication is a key to sucsess in all professions that we have !
And I think that I made the right choice of profession - it is the perfect combination : a very progressiv form of modern technology , and the most important thing - it is extremly interesting to me !
Regarding the Accomodation at the camp , I would prefer the tents , because it is something different wich you do n't do every day !
Finaly I 've got a question : What clothes must I bring with me and how much money ?
yours faithfuly ,
Another thing that makes you fourious is when you see a great shirt in a shop and somebody else takes it away or buys it before you can react .
At that time I was lucky and also , I would like to recommand it to other friends .
But people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there are n't convenient appliaces in their houses yet .
I 'm writting to you to explain the problem that I have had in your theatre .
I recentely had a week 's holiday in London , and , during my stay , I went to your theatre to see " Over the Rainbow " because I had seen an advertisement for this show and I was really interrested in seeing it for many reasons , one of the reasons is that I love the star , Danny Brook .
Secondly , in your advertisement the time of the show was 19:30 and in reallity the show started at 20:15 and the discount was not available .
I think you can do a lot more things now than before with techonology .
best reguard .
There are many ways to earn money , especially in a big city , like the one where we are studing all year around .
To be more technical and specific , we need a very flexible job , wich gives us independence and allows us to stop working when we are not able to , for example during the exams period .
As a result I asked my acquintance to come with me to the show .
By the time he got out of the building , the cops were everywhere but as long as Mallory is alive , he wo n't be arrested , with his unpredicatable mind .
Secondly , we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to take a seat and the show finally beginned at 8:15 !
At that time , I used to buy a lotery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts .
One day , while I was checking my weekly ticket , I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substancial amount of money .
I had to wait ten days before the lotery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won .
But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smillingly and I found out that I had many unsuspected friends ... Not long after , they were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them ; some proposed going shopping , others going to the cinema and a restaurant .
Finally the end of the week came and I went to the lotery office to find out the amount I had won .
With this letter I would like to ask you if you wuld change it because we saw in the London Advertiser an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
The show is on Tuesday , March 14th , from 10.00 - 19.00 in the Central Exibition Hall .
Yours sincierly ,
I knew that my brother was at home , althoug I did n't know where he was .
In fact when I do n't feel very happy I decide to go shopping to try to cher myself up .
It is at this moment when really I realiase I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling .
Another thing is my accommodation . I prefer to have log cabins because it 's easyeast for me .
And how much meney I should take ?
If you have chilldren , you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the chilldren see something they want to have , they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them , sometimes they even cry or shout at you and it is really anoy .
Anyway , in families they usauly have this problem that when they buy a new one , suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and chilldren .
Eventually I like shopping too and I beleive everybody likes shopping , but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough meney to survive .
Secondly , my choise is the accommodation in tents . I think it could be more interesting . I could enjoy my time with other people playing , eating and talking outside . In my opinion if I choose the log cabin it will be like being at home .
My other choise is painting . I have been painting since I was ten years old . I used to go to special classes and I do n't mind if you need me to help in the class .
The most popular " sport " that everyone does is obiously shopping .
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression . You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have , buying clothes , jewells , furniture , etc .
But other people do n't think like this . For example , there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without inttetion the girl got lost .
The mother was shocked . She did n't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going in and out the places . It was a nightmare but fortunaly the police found her .
Can you imagen being in Japan or China and having to go to the shops ?
I do n't think that I 'd enjoy it , all the people knicking you , you ca n't walk properly or buy anything . And also there are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops . I mean that some people can fight to get something .
Dear MANANGER of the theatre
So try to imagine my situation . I had paied a lot of money and I did n't see a good show . I am really disappointed .
Unfortunatety , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Many years ago , more or less seventy years ago a young man , with an exellent capacity for thinking and inventing things , started building a big thing called a " time machine " .
The only thing Pat had to do was to choose a date , one he liked , and to press the starter botton , and you know what ? He did it !
I am very happy to hear from you that I have won first prize in your competition - twe weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. and I am writing to tell you my information .
Firstly , I will be able to travel only in July because I go to univercity and I normaly spend most of the time working . to do . and I have holiday only in July .
And I choose phtograghy and tennis from the activities list .
I am taking photograghy lessons at univercity and I started tennis when I was 10 so I am good at bouth of them .
From the 10 opitions that I have to choose from I will choose two , climbing , wich I have been doing for three years because I know it by heart , and swimming wich I have also been doing every day as part of my daily rotine in Portugal .
I hope that coming after jully wo n't disturb Camp California 's plans for me .
A survey has been done , and the issue is wich subjects ( lessons ) and activities the students think are the most enjoyable .
Someone says it is maths - pratical , usefull - but the majority say it is boring , unless you 're choosing a job which demands all your maths knowledge such as accounting , otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer .
The majorite have chosen History , which means a big journey around the world , either at the Roman life style , or in the midle ages , when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands .
At all schools there is a similar daily life wich must be filmed . This is an important part of our life , wich is full of emotions in development .
How has mordern technology changed my daily life ?
Sometimes , I think I am a computer addict because whenever I come back home , my hand goes to the computer swich , automaticaly , even though I do n't want to use the computer .
I recive a paper in which I was told about a play you are putting on and of the advantages I would get if I went to see it . I wish that had never happened .
I am realy desappointed , and I want to have my money back .
First of all , on the sheet I recived , it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actors . That is not true , because insted of him , there was another actor , and I do n't know what his name is .
You must understand that you promised me I 'd have a good evening and I realy did n't .
I write this letter to tell you about the programme that starts tomorrow , about that exelent book I have told you to read .
This exelent book tells the story of a man of 25 years that has a little boy , his son , that lives in a very bad condicion .
The book is very easy to read , but if you do n't have time I recomended listening to the programme .
Also , that they will invite a psicologist , the Autor of the book and maybe the president will talk so I recommend you listen to it .
I might say that I am really good at swimming and sailling because I have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and I have had a really good training in water sports .
As you know , I 'd never been to any activities as a valunteer before .
The concert tickets were very expensive and I 'd seen an adversitement on TV .
It said , " Be a valunteer at our concert and get a free ticket . "
We have bought some snaks to eat and three students will sing for him , too .
I 've just recived your leter , and I must say that I am so surprised . I was n't expecting to win it .
I am still studing at the moment I will finish at the end of June so I will be able to leave at the beginning of July .
Regarding the acomodation , I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent so as to get a better rest . I have a problem sleeping and a log cabin will be more peaceful than a tent .
It 's quite dificult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot , wich are climbing , tennis , surfing and photography , but if I have to make a choise , I choose climbing and surfing .
I 'm rather experienced at climbing . I have done it once a mounth since I was 17 .
But on the other hand , I have never been surfing . I am a complete Beginer but I am dying to do it .
A good idea to start will be an alarm clock ringing close to his bed , because that 's the way everyone gets up in the morning ( apart from the people who do n't do anythink ) .
After this introduction , it will be time to show some of the acitivities everyone can do at the school , such as lesons or others like the library , our protagonist having a cofe with some coleagues in the cofe bar , the reception service .
First of all , the most favorable time for me to travel is July , because I am in the final year of University , so I have to attend classes for a thesis almost throughout the year apart from July , when I can take a relatively long summer holiday .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in log cabins to staying in tents , since I have had a horrible experience being attaked by a swarm of midges , when I camped out .
This is based on a questionnair conducted in the school and our English department 's investigation .
According to statistics based on the questionnair , the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class .
In fact , I visited some Englishe classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers .
Consequently , it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atomosphere may be able to be filmed .
The girls ' football team is also famous for its reputation of keeness on practice .
Actually , I can work with it in my office and visitting some website using the new technologies such as the Internet .
The new inventions have transformed my life , so it is easier with modern technology ( the mobile , the car , the plane , the coach , the train , the medical advances and domestic appliances ) , they have created more confortable and pleasure .
In fact , I expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffured . I trust you will give immediate attention to this letter and I look forward to receiving a satisfactory responce by return of post within a week .
When we think about clothes in the future , we should think about the enviroment first .
Of course , technology will have developped enough for us to invent new material for those kinds of clothes .
So we do n't have to worry about how heavey they will be .
Firstly , I expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but I felt very angry when I saw diffrent actors .
What is more , you advertize there were discounts available but there were not .
You said that the musicial show started at 19.30 but recently it began at 20.15 .
When I was 16 years old I fell in love with the most hundsom boy in our school .
Everybody started to laught at me .
I 'm sorry to tell you that I 'm really disappointed with your advertisment for the musical show at the Circle Theatre .
And because of these circumstands , I would like to have a part of my money back .
Faithully ,
He said , ' shure , no problem ' .
As to accomodation I would like to choose a tent because I am used to travelling with my sleeping bag and my tent all over Europe .
I am very good at basketball , and even if I am not a tall boy , I am a good playmaker and I play in a local team .
I connected wires , I caried loudspeakers , and so on .
Towards the end of the concert I hansled a bottle of wine to Poolo Conte .
As you know he 's my favorite singer .
Secondly , the two activities wich I 'd like to do during the camp are sailing and surfing .
When you go to a shop it is dificult to find what you are looking for without the help of the shop assistant .
After that you have to wait a long time in the qeue to pay and many times it is n't possible to pay with your credit card and you do n't have any money in cash .
You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , whose music is my favourate , but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of .
When they finished singing the last song I was surprice when they called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people .
I am not goot at either of them .
I haven't writen a letter to you for ages .
I did n't need to pay an enterence fee because I was working there .
Plus , I got an authography from a popular singer . I 'll give you the authography as a present .
It is valuable of keeping on your suvinier .
I would offer you one suggestion that concers the classical concerts .
For me , it 's very stressfull and I usually run a lot to do it .
In response to your letter that I received last Saturday I am writting to answer your questions .
I usualy sing in my spare time and my friends love it when I sing and regarding swimming I was champion last year in my city .
Are tablets necessary ( for headach , insects ) ?
It is wonderfull how tecnology makes things so easy .
That will be great because teachers are part of our life and they have to receive all our attention and friendship because if it was n't for them we would never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidents and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget .
The reasonably - piced package , including tickets and accomodations , well suited my personal situation : comfortable rooms that are easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide at the last minute .
- emprove your kindness and ask for work in restaurants or bars . It is a good training period for real life too ( being patient with demanding people is required ) .
- check your wallet and if you have enough money ( a very small amount ) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Phili , Cuba , Zambania , and Morocco where people ( poorer than you ) will offer low wages for ôsmallö jobs .. you might enjoy your summer holidays and ôfind yourselfö
I am keen on singing and I have won sevral singing competitions at school .
When I first entred the concert hall , I was given a pass for working here .
The programme is very exating and interesting , especially the river trip to Greenwich .
This is the arrangement that we fouded with the other students and everyone agreed .
We had n't enough money to buy food or new clothes and the worst was that my youngerst brother was terribly ill , and without money we could n't take him to a doctor .
I want to travel only in July becouse now I 'm studying at National Academy of Defense and I do n't have time for enything else .
I prefer that becouse I will travel with my wife and she always prefers that kind of accommodation .
I tell you in sicryt that I do n't know whay she does that .
I like to catch fisch too .
My personal best is 27.66 for fivety meters . I would like to ask you about the weather in California in Julay .
Are there any discoteks or something ? I would like to know if my wife can come with me , becouse without her I ca n't be there .
Everybody gets up at six , and the first thing they do is run for about two thousends five houndred metres .
Then they take a schower and everybody goes for breakfast .
Two times a week I have W - F. This is very important , becouse every soldier schould be strong .
After this competition there was mathematics , and two houers of biology .
I do n't like biology , so I sleept on the desk in a classroom .
I think that competitions should be filmed becouse my school is a kind of sports school .
On video there schould be howe we get up .
Houe we run , houe we eat breakfast .
Then you should schow houe ouer school looks from outside .
There schould be an intereview with students and with profesons .
Daily life at my school is not only school and teachers and mathematicas problems .
We must knou how to use a gun , or how to drive a tank .
And , finally , right before the start they announced that Danny Brook woud not be in the show that evening .
After the show I was not surpised at all to learn that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration .
Undoubtfully , modern technology has changed my daily life .
And the best word I can use to describe all the changes is " drastical " .
Among the greatest inventions of man I come accross dayly are the telephone , computer and automobile .
The computer , probably the must versatile invention , allows me to get access to huge informatonal sources through the Internet , to do shopping without leaving my house , to do my work more effectively and quickly .
People used to wear very diffrent things from the clothes we wear now , we would n't even say that they are ' clothes ' .
The things that people wear are changing all the time , everyone tries to be diffrent in public and very different sorts of clothes are being created .
I belive they will wear very diffrent things .
By contrast , in the future , I guess we would rather go back to the acient time , owing to have natural life style . We will be unwilling to give housework away .
They are more comfortable and really match with the enveiroment .
Although this is a new experience , I would prefer climbing and Photographe .
The concert was a big success , a lot of excitment .
The students mentionned that it would be very interessting to show the English lesson because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to find out about our English course .
Additionally , the advertisement said I could visit the threatre restaurant after the show .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrects .
I told Pat everything even my secrects when we were still friendly .
However , we are not friends anymore because of a secrect in the past .
I told Pat that my father and mother were going to seperate .
Maybe it was the wrong decision to tell her . She began to share that secrect with everybody , including the teachers .
Finally , I decided to go to another school and I will not tell any secrect to anyone .
To begin with , in your letter you asked me when I would like to travell .
Thanking you in advance for your help , I look forward to hearin from you .
Also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes there are planned visities to historical places .
In this lesson you can learn how to speak , write and read this foreing language with teachears that are well prepeared .
theater
To sum up , it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting lessons and some optionaly activities to do in your free time .
Regarding accommnodation at Camp California , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is safier than a tent .
Now , my English teacher has asked me to explane what I think .
In my opinion , nowdays , shopping is very easy and at the same time very hard .
Amazingly , doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time : shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains .
About the activities that I can do at the camp , I chose to play Basketball , which is my favourite sport , because I want to do some excersise while I am on vacation .
I also chose Fotography because it is one of my hobbies .
I 'm writting you a letter , because you are the organiser of an International Arts Festival .
There is only one bad fhing , that this festival was too short .
I 've just received this letter from you , so I 'm writting to you .
On Sathurday and Sunday we do n't have lessons , but it does n't seem that we do n't have work .
I do n't have troubbles with my education . My friends and teachers are nice and friendly , but there is one thing I 'd like to change in my school .
I 'd like to have more tests during the whole course , not only at the end , because it 's making me very lasy .
Appart from that , the show was delayed forty - five minutes , consequently , everybody there lost control and became angry .
Finally I would like to inform you that I have never had such an umpleasant evening in my whole life .
The worst was that he did it unconciously .
Later , I realiced it was the worst thing that could happen to me .
I 'm writting to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held a few days ago .
For example , there were some conert halls which were too small to hold so many people , the stars and artists were just from six countries , which is not enough for the audience .
This reminds me of what I experienced during my teeenage years .
We believe that the programme is very cood and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time especially for that .
The exhibition is caud the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it takes place at the Central Exhibition hall , in London , From 10.00 till 19.00 .
The class is very excited about that because the Show conteins the latest Fashions , leisure and Sports Wear , make - up and hairstyles .
Of course if you are in the public eye , the reasons why you want privacy are different , because if you are a politician , for exmaple , you fear for your life .
Becaue
As for accomodation I would prefer to stay in tents .
It is amazing and sometimes amuzing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is .
But I do feel ill at ease when I see dissappointed or angry assistants ' faces on leaving the magic world without any souvenirs of it !
I do appologize about that .
If this is an unconvenience , please feel free to tell me .
Quess what I 've done !
The preperation days came .
I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzing !
In particular , going to the Museum and the Art Gallery will be a great oppotunity for all of us , as they are world - famous places in London .
It was okay , beause I was quite good at that , but the problem was that I had to jump onto the roof !
Another point which I think was ennoying was the concert hall .
Yours Sinccerly
Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunatly the school that I 'm going to is like a military camp .
My family allows me almost everything except smoking and drinking alchol of course , which I do n't do anyway .
So if it 's possible could you arrenge it for me please .
And also , I would prefer the log cabins to the tents , as I have never slept in a sleepin bag before .
All of her funs were stooud up the whole concert and dancing .
Some of the funs were not good at all because they shouted and argued , but most of the people were very good .
I must say though , I would have to travel in July because it 's the summer holydays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible .
A log cabin would be the ideal accomodation . Presumably they are more spacious than tents and it would be easier to keep tidy .
I would like to know how much money people ussually take and how much clothing .
I know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help , but to my suprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected .
Thirsthly , I would prefer to swim and play tennis , because I have been doing this since I was I child , and I think I am very good at each activity .
A few minutes later the show started and the grup appeared on the stage .
Later , when the show had finished , I stayed with the grup in their room for a few minutes .
What I really liked doing was helping them with their clothes and make - up , because I learnt how to do make - up for someone and I spent a few minutes with the most popular grup in the world .
Regarding starting time and the theatre restaurant , to see the musical I had to wait about 45 minuits because it started at 20:15 .
I know you are always interested in detictive stories , especially Agatha Christie 's . Do n't be surprised !
Where the stories are concerned , they will not be difficult to understand because you already know the stories and the naraitors are going to read clearly .
Regarding the accomodation , I would be pleased to stay in a tent , because this reminds me of my holidays with my family .
I just had to take care of them , serving some drinks and food during the rehearshals .
I write to complein about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I had a very disapointing evening because of many things .
First the actor was a wery average actor .
Also in the advicement they talk about discount tikets .
Well they did n't accept my £ 20 discount tiket . Why ?
And finally I could n't visit the theater restaurant after the show , it was closed . Why ?
Alslo I wanted to tell you that the show was very borring .
It was alwais the saim .
Because of all these things it obiously was n't the perfect evening as was seid in the advicement .
I had to explain to everybody that I actually did n't have a girlfriend . I explein to them that it was a good posibility , nothing else , but no one belive me , because Pat had told them that I had an actual girlfriend .
This problem with Pat had a lot of consecuences , because I had a very hevy discucion with her about it . It was so heay that one of ower teachers had to calm me down , because I was very angree with her .
Regarding the accomodation , if possible I would like to stay in a tent because I think it is a relaxing place to stay .
And if during the nights there are any entrotenements ?
The opposite situation is when I pass my exams and I really need to buy something as a preseant for myself .
It is really intresting .
That is the second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning and lasts untill 19.00 .
This technologic improvement is changing people 's lives , behaviour , even their homes .
But we ca n't stop these technologic improvements .
We should use them in positif ways .
and we are practicing these things .
In the future life will be more artifitual than it was .
How delighted I was when I receved your letter !
I would like to ask you how much money I need , how the weather is , in order to pack the necessary clothing , and wheter I need anything else .
I am sending you some pictures , the best ones only because there were some quite embarrasing ones .
It was n't a spokeperson Kim but just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage .
You did n't tell us any detile about how much the ticket costs to go inside .
In my class room somary people stay outside London about 50% in my class room and everyone is verry worried about how they can stay for three days in London .
And we 're very exsciting about your programme .
Becauses in London there are a lot of shopping places , can you tell us about shopping and the time For spend or day ?
Thank you For any detile more I think we go with you and enjoy a Fantatics programme .
If I tell someting in the college baby someone like or dislike about my story but I think my story it very good for someone .
In my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir . and we have got three buillding and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experied about teaching I think somebody come in my college you fried want to studdy in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you ca n't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortible .
It starts with food ( monstruous ) and goes on to clothes , pills , games and so on .
A simple and well - proofen architecture .
Every electronic gadget in the futur home will be able to comunicate with other machines or computers .
Regarding the accommodation at the camp , I would prefer a tent . The reason is that I like to live realy naturally and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent than in a cabin .
It was marvelous .
It was hard work for a while but I was so happy to help at a really big pop concert I ca n't decribe it .
I realy enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest , if not the greatest experience of my life .
The organizer of the tournement spoke with me and asked me if I wanted to do the same work in two months at the Rolling Stones concert Is n't that fantastic !
That 's the most suitable accomodation for a camping holiday .
They also gave me a ticket to wotch the concert live .
I was realy happy to be seeing the " Best Musical Show " in London .
By problems I mean that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts avaivable ?
The most disappointing thing was that there were diffrent actors to those advertised who were not very good at acting .
It was n't realy a perfect evening as you promised on your flyer .
I was very disapointed and I would like to have my money back .
If you think about the early days , when no cars were on the roads and no one had an opertunity to fly to another country for a holiday , people had to walk or go by horse and ship .
Today , everyone has the opertunity to just get into a car and drive wherever they want to .
This is also a very big disatvantage because many people are losing thier jobs .
Another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because they wath TV or play or work on the Computer and do n't see each other anymore because they do n't have to .
We can hardly imagine life without compures , TV sets , microwaves , and so many other things , and yet none of these things existed seventy years ago .
Her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help thier child and that is the reason why I 'm writing this story .
I have receveid your letter concerning two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
Regarding my accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin because it 's more confortable than a tent and less hot with the sun .
However , I hope , there is water and light inside this log cabine .
The salewomen are too busy and haven't a moment to give you advice .
The other one is tennis , which is also my favorite sport and I have been playing for several years .
Lastly , I would like to know how many people are comming to the Camp I will go to .
I sould be grateful if you would send me the further information that I asked for and I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Favorite lessons
Favorite activities
I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see : It is " The London Fashion and Leisure Show " , which is going to take place at the Central Exibition Hall in London , on Tuesday the 14th March , between 10.00 and 19.00 .
I 'm very pleased to recived this prize .
Other workers are taking on other months so there is only July that is availible for me .
I 'm very good at tennis , and I was a profeshional tennis player .
Unforgivly , my climbing skill is nothing like my tennis skill , but I always love climbing .
I 'm afrade of hights and I have always wanted to conqure that fear !
Filming life at school means filming the students ' actions and behaveare .
It is very interesting and fun with the experement .
Lots and lots of experements produce quite interesting and amazing results and I think Science is very useful in life .
Also it is not a very easy subject so we can capture other students ' faces in confusion and puzzal .
We can see students expressing their feelings , wonderful and excitting story that the student made up or from a well well - known story .
Another excitting subject which most of the students like very much is P.E. Many students like to play sports .
I do a lot of sports , so apart from playing tennis I am a member of our local swimming centre . I can reasure you that I am gradually improving my sports skills .
It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4,000 seats for the " spactetors " if you can call them that .
The musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of sound quality .
I visited your theater and I was very dissapointed for a number of reasons .
I 've read your advertisment and the reality was different to what was written there .
There was no Danny Brook but instead of him there was a different actor and I 'm very dissapointed about that because I 'm a fan of his .
There were no discounts availible so I overspent .
The theater restaurant was closed for no reason apparent to me .
It was a realy bad evening and because of that could you possibly give me my money back ?
Everything was going perfectly befor last month when I met a girl from the other school .
So one day she invited me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illigal .
So I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climed out of the window .
Next day my best friend went to the headmaster and told him about me so he put me on sespend .
At this we can see the latest fashions , imagintive make - up and hairstyles .
I am sorry to cause you inconveint .
Last night , when I went into my house it was quite scilence .
My father always remembered his responsibily was to provide his workers with a good salary , which is the aim of his life .
When I , with mixed feelings , went home I found my parents were stooding at the door looking very cheerful . '
It is a good idea to include the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery in the morning on Tuesday and Wednesday respectivelly .
Firstly , there will be leisur and sports wear and the latest fasions .
Secondly , there will be exibitions about makeup and hairstyles .
And on Tuesday we will enjoy the London fasion and Leisure Show till 19.00 .
I am looking forward to recieving your positive reply .
We are intrsted in politicians ' and film stars ' clothes , hobbies , passions and intrigues .
There are lardge numbers of journalists following them all the time , even in their private life .
We can go for a wolk , go shopping , go to the cinema , get marrige or devorce .
Why must everybody know and tolk about their private life ?
I was not satified with the show at all because it was very different from the description your advertisement had given .
It was a desaster and I am going to tell you why .
But it has advantatges as well as disadvantatges .
On the other hand there are disadvatatges , too .
Firstly , the enviroment is polluted because of technology , although this is our fault .
Secondly for us there are disadvantatge because pollution affects us indirectly , and because I do n't do anything but watch television , and it is n't very good at all .
I am writing to complan about your service .
You were meant to start the show at 19.30 p.m. but you started very late at 20.15 p.m withour any ecxpenetion to the audience .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I knew that but I needed someone who could understent and support me at that moment .
I told her about my pregnency because she has a friend who works in a hospital as a doctor .
I asked her for hepl and she promised me she would do everything that she could and keep my secret .
Pat gave me some advice and I disayded to have an operetion .
I got a bit dipress but my parents supported me .
They stopped me having the operetion .
You wo n't wait in the quee .
I am a good swimmer and also good at golf ( handicap twelve ) . I took a certificate to become a Teachear in both of them six years ago before I went to " CROARA GOLF " in Milan where I organised the evening 's entertainment for the customers .
First of all , I belive that if someone has time to go to the shops has the possibility .
Do you know I am amuzing when it comes to playing tennis ?
Great fun , very happy , if go with your girlfriend it will feel romatic , you should think something like this , but do you know it is not always like this ?
If you interested in the clothes as well , but you need to remember , one is male , but one is female , they should have diffence fashion , at that moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat , so in the end you both will feel unhappy or angry with each other .
Mr. Maneger ,
In this unconfortable situation I am writting to tell you about some irratable problems .
Then , the time stated as the beginning of the show was 19:30 and unfortunatly it began at 20:15 .
Closing these facts , when the musical finished I was very , after wainting for the start of the musical and I was dissapointed with this version of Over the Rainbow . Everybody went to the restaurant , wich was closed without any explanation .
I am very dissapointed with this evening and with this desorganized way of dealing with problems so I am asking for my money back .
They always did things together , and they were the most popular boys in school . Both were very hanson , played football ; they were an example for everybody .
Unable to keep a secret he told everyone , ended his friendship with Ted . Now Ted is rejective by everyone , no one talks to him and Pat is the example , but without his best friend and his honestity .
In accodance with what you have told me about the accommodation I would prefer to go and stay in tents , because I think they 're unusual and that is not something that you do every day .
In my oppinion you have to give some money back to me .
She is a very good girl and she can deal with every promblem she has .
My name is Agripina T. I just recive your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions .
While I 'm at the Camp , I would like to do two of my favorite activities , which are basketball and singing .
In the past I was in a basketball team and I enjoyded it a lot .
At the Camp , is there a free uniform or will we have to wear something spessial ?
And is it nesessary to bring money , will we need it ?
Students think that we do n't do anything and we do n't learn anything spessial .
Our music lessons are speccial .
And it 's always interesting to wach others while they do something like that .
You can find futher information from me about Camp California in the USA .
First of all I can go to Camp California only in July because I will start working at our local leisure centre as a swimming instructer .
I would like to stay in a log cabin because I have had bad experiens with tents .
We are all costemers of the big supermarkets . They have all that we need .
But when we think about it seriously , shopping is not enjoyable , for example , if you forget something that you need for a salat .
You have to go back to the supermarket and find the nearest parking space , then before someone takes the last fresh lemon for your salat , you must find out where the lemon section is , because they love to change the store around again and again .
Firstly , I read in the advertisment that the actor would be Danny Brook , and this is one of the reasons why I went to the theatre .
But I had a big suprise when I saw that it was a different actor , and I was very disappointed .
I was very ungry with her . I did n't know what to do , I was afraid that I had lost all my friends .
After a few seconds of thought I went straigh to Pat . " Why , why did you do that ? "
Firstly , you advertised that Danny Brook , who is my favorite , is the lead but there was another actor insted of him .
In accordance with study or work , I use the Internet , which is the easist way to get information from all around the world .
When I asked for the price I was surprised becaused the assistant told me there was n't any discount available .
After two hours I thought that all of this information was writted from a foreign point of view and it was n't the native opinion .
I used my computer to collect reports from the Internet and I can promise I found so much information that I could n't analize it in two weeks .
Changes wo n't stop caming : the WAP technology ( you 'll buy a cake from a vending machine without any coins , only one call ) , digital TV , virtual reality and more ...
I would prefer to stay in a tent to staying in a cabin . Because it is something I feel more familia with . I used to go camping with my family every summer .
Sometimes you can stay out all day just to buy a present for someone . It stard in the morning , and of course you have breakfast somewhere , and it gets later and you are still looking for it , so you have lunch , and finaly you spend more money than you thought you would .
RECOMMONDATIONS
I have just received your letter informing me that I won a two week holiday at Camp California , so I am writing to you to tell you my preferences for the travel and the accomodation .
About the accomodation , I have no problems , but I would prefer staying in a tent , so that the holiday may be more adventurous .
First of all , the reason why I bought the ticket was Danny Brook , who is my favorite star , and was going to appear in the show .
I could say that we can not servive without them .
It is getting more convinient and useful than our past life .
Furthermore , it is possible to treat many patients who have serious desease more effectively , if we use modern technology in medical science .
Because of convinience , we can use our time more effectively , but we should not rely on these things too much .
Last week I attended the musical " Over the rainbow " , and I am writting in order to complain about things that really disappointed me .
Hello . I 'm Robert and I 'm writting an article about clothes in the future .
In my oppinion , in a hundred years we 'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays .
I recived your letter and I 'm very happy because I did n't expect it , so first of all I want you to know that I really fancy going to Camp California in the U.S.A . for two weeks , especially because I 've never been to this country .
Finally I want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clotches on the camp .
I look forward to reciving a reply from you .
We arrived quite early because we had to work out how we were going to serve people did with which order , so we started putting all the stuff in the appropiate place .
I was very nervous because I 'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and I could n't help it and I started crying - you can imagine , they were so handsome that I could n't belive it - I tried to calm down because I had to work , and later I began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream .
I want to know if it is avaliabile at that time .
Fathermore , I would like to ask you which kind of clothes I need to take and how much money I 'll spend .
But a lot of incovenients anoy them .
First of all the parking is not convinent and is expensive .
Sometimes you have to park your car in a futher place then walk to the supermarket .
Futhermore , when you look aroud the supermarket , you ca n't easyly find the goods which you want to buy .
It 's very confusing without the right singho .
As I understand , it is very imortant to confirm the date of my trip .
Now about accomodation . If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a tent .
I am quite good at tennis , especially plaing doubles .
Also I like swimming and I 've got two years ' experience of teaching swimming at a lesure centre .
I ca n't concentrate in a shop , and I ca n't relaxe either .
On the other hand , I understand very well that it is really nesseceraly . I also understand that nobody will do that in my place .
I think it is an opportunity to meet different people ( even if they are pushing you ) , to understand what they like and what they do n't , because even some kinds of food can be in fashing .
I am writting this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening at your musical show " Over the rainbow " at the Circle Theatre where you are the director .
This was a very difficult decission but I had to take it because of my personal situation , all the time shouting and fighting with all my family .
I 'm writing this letter to you to make a complaint about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " which I saw yesterday . I have to say that I 'm very disappointed with what I saw because after seeing your advertisment I expected more . The show was entirely different to what it says in the advertisment .
I was a little more portient so I stayed to watch the whole show , which by the way was the worst I have ever seen .
I do n't know why I paid £ 20 with no discount , which the advertisements said I woul have .
Then I thougt that I should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that I could n't say that I had wasted my time by coming here .
Competers have entirely changed people 's lives .
There are hundrets of prograns which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger who you want to meet .
I wo n't ever forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the thruth about my strange disease .
Before it was packed into by the audience , we had to clean around the reception , but totally it was really exciting although I was just a member of staff in the small reception , because I felt great excitement ( especially girls ! ) from people queing .
I know this is one right love . I 'm absolutely besorrted with him .
She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always makes a joke of it . That makes me feel so embarrised : I was very angry at that time !
Amaisingly , we can find that there are more and more computer users .
My daily life has also changed a lot through the use of computers or mordern technology .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in and they are n't very cozy .
I would like to ask you for vegetarian food for me as I am a very extrict vegan , and to suggest what kind of clothes to bring .
In a nutchel I think Maths , basketball , Speech and Drama , and History should be filmed .
Firsty , I would like to thank you warmly for this great prize .
Of course we will also show other activities , such as PE , the lunch break and the theater workshop .
It was n't a " perfect evening out " like you said in the advertisement , so my friends and I would be gratefull if you would give us some money back , if that is possible .
Your faightfully
It 's a sad story but it lets you know about a tipe of life that you ca n't imagine really exists .
I would like to travel only in July , because I am going to study at my university untill the end of June .
I have a lot of posibilities for spending my spare time .
Generally I paint some landscapes by using watercolours , but sometimes I try to paint like during the impresionist era by using blobs , oil paint and canvases .
In order to preper it I visited some clasrooms during the lessons and I interviewed a number of students from our school .
Some of the teachers are very good profesionalists .
Their lessons are valuable , rich in knowledge and funy .
According to students ' oppinions , the most popular activities are basketball , tennis , swimming and also the photography group and the painting team .
It could maks the video more interesting .
It will show that during every day we have great fun and we recived good , important knowledge .
My school starts a summer holyday from 1st July and I am going to take a summer course from August .
They can relax , reduce ther stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted .
However , shopping sometimes makes them stressfull . People often waste money on worthless things .
During the camp I would like to pratise my swimming ( I have attended swimming lessons for 3 years ) and also I would like to learn how to take some good photos .
Sometimes , unfortunatelly shopping can be very annoying , especially at Christmast or Easter time .
The only advice would be : " Do not do your shopping at Christmast or Easter time " - but it will not make any sense , will it ?
In addition to this , it was not the famous actors that you had mentionned in the advertisement performing , so we were disappointed .
Then I had to wait 45 mins ; the show started at 20:15 .
At that moment I was realy angry , so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant , but it was closed , because of its bad hygiene and food .
Now I only need to push a button , and things or mashines work on their own .
Homework is easer to do with the cumputer than with a book sometimes .
Maybe , I wo n't be able to understand how the things work and that scares me . I will be useless , because a mashine will do all the work .
To begin with , it was not Danny Book who acted in the show , as you wrotte .
And then about the tickets , you wrotte that there were discounts available but there were not .
Finaly when we had seen the Musical , we went to the restaurant and it was closed because they were doing some dekoreting , and you wrott in your advertisement , " Visit our theatre restaurant after the show "
I am looking forwart to hearing from you .
Clothes are a very interesting subjekt to study .
If you travlling around you can see a lot of difference still between different cultures .
First I think that in the future we are going to wear fewer clothes because the climet is going to get warmer and warmer .
Finaly in my opinion I wish we would dress more as we did in the past , using natural matrial . We must think more about the eviorment and live closer to nature .
In the past , for example , we used to write letters to comunicate , but now we surely send an e - mail , a fax or make a phone call .
Nowadays , you get everything immediatly , but will it always be a good thing ? I think not .
So they prefer to leave their sons wecting TV .
In my view , it was extremely interesting and satisfing for me all the concert long .
Although I can not explain any more about the thing I felt during the concert in this letter , I 'd like to recomend you to help at a pop concert .
I am afraid that I could n't write to you immediatly , but last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and so I was very busy .
Regarding the accomodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin .
I think that the combins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes .
I chose climbing because I 'm intrested in this sport even though I 'm not experienced .
Yours sincierly
Before the concert I helped with carring and putting in order some chairs on which some special people would sit .
In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and get a lot of autogrammes by them .
I was doing different activities , from designering fliers to selling tickets .
In addition I checked the e - mail dialy and answered the phone .
In the advertisement it said that discounts were availble , but when I asked a member of staff in the theatre about the discount he did n't offer me one .
I excpect this will be possible .
Like earings , necklaces , bracelets , rings , glasses , hair bands , handbags , shoes , watches , etc .
We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical " Over the Rainbow " at the " Circle Theater " .
So when the miserable musical came to its end , we were happy to leave the theater auditorium , but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant , because no restaurants were open anymore , because it started too late .
Pat was my big brother , who had heaed of some people paying , " safty - money " , but never know the reason , until he found a large amout of money in my room .
Yeah fokes , that was the point I got interupted by my parents in this beautiful dream , but if you want to hear the end of my story than buy the " Rossall - School - magazin " , next issue , and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story .
Secondly , for accomodation , I prefer to say in log cabins , as I have no experience staying in a tent , I hesitate to try .
I used to belong to the singing club when I was a high school student and once we won the contest , moreover , painting is one of my favorite hobbies .
Finally , I would like to ask you wheather there is anything I should bring on this trip such as specific clothes , extra money etc .
It was a privelage to help at a pop concert .
My dear friend , if I tell you this , I am sure you will get jelous .
Dear Sir or Madamme ,
I 'd appriciate for giving me the first prize in the competition .
The aim of this report is to summerize the results of the survey , which is about making a short video .
Yet , one extremly hot day while I was pacefully walking by the sea and thinking about my own problems , I discovered my elder brother 's girlfriend with another boy .
So , the next day , I nervously came to Pat 's appartment where she had been living on her own since she was eighteen .
From the activities , I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - and Photography - about which I know just the basical skills .
Besides , it was confirmed by scientists that consumism may develop into a compulsion .
First of all , I was looking forward to seeing one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook , and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent actor instead of him in spite of his name being writen in the advertisement .
I 'm writting this letter to inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I visited the Circle Theatre .
It 's something absoletuly necessary for every action people perform . It affects us both positively and negatively .
I 'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interresting in doing in London while we 're there .
First of all , we 'd like to thank you for the programme you have already arranged . It 's wonderful because it covers most of our interrests .
But also we would like to visit The London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be held at the Central kExhibition Hall on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 - 19:00 .
Thank you for your time . We 're looking forward to hearing from you opion .
I had always wanted to travel abroad and experiece other people 's lives and cultures , so I decided to go to Paris as soon as I finished university .
But in spite of all of these desadventages , I was pursuing my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything I was going to do it .
It took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole familly had fallen in love with me , so that when they decided to move to London , they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the familly , even though it was very hard at the beggining .
First of all , the starrings of the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
But your starrings were not there .
From every singular things I have complained , it was totally different from what your advertisment said .
And I can send e - mail to my friends via the Internet fastly and cheaply compared to the old - style mail - services .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the disappointing expirience I had with your theatre .
And last , the most disappointing thing , the advertisement also said that Danny Brook would be there , my favorite actor , but there was someone else instead of him .
So , the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that the advertisement promissed .
So , that afternoon at lunchtime , I went into the teachers ' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quitely and calmly .
That was the most scarely and daring thing that I did in my childhood .
Sencerely ...
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets and so his whole schoole knew about Sara 's experience .
Sara was a very good puple .
She spent the money on a magazin .
I am writing to you to thank you for your very good organisation of the International Arts Festival , where I spent two exellent days recently .
I suggest it would be very intresting to meet artists from faraway and exotic countries .
To finish my letter , I hope that my notes can help you to make next year 's festival more intersting and comfortable for the public .
It is so because you are young and need to make your life as intrestng as it can be now .
Naturally , it 's easier to get a job when you are good at foreign languagers or computers .
Also some concert holls were too small for this many people .
The school is like a dungeen here .
I do n't want to be so evel about school but rules are rules and they are limiting us within the borders of our school .
We are not allowed to compare our thoughts during the lessons becase the teachers think that we are chatting .
I had been looking forward to seeing my favorite actor Danny Brook , but he had been replaced by some other actor .
I was not too happy about that and why did n't the show start when it was suposed to start ?
Your advertisement was ful of false advertising .
I hope you preciate my letter and that you 'll try to amend these problems./ Sally Svenssen
I do n't have to mess around in the supermarket on a Friday evening , when I 'm tired from school , I just get all the groseries I need delivered to my door instead .
Nowdays I spend 2 hours in front of the computer every day , shopping or chatting to people .
The last thing I would like to know is what clothes I have to take , even though the weathe in July will be good .
So , let 's imagen that your credit card is not working , or some one stold your cash from your pocket .
Also it is very difficult to shop if you are handicapt .
Staying in a que or croude is also unplesent .
Your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracies ; this show did not sart at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15 .
Under these circumstances , as your Theatre did not fullfil its commitments , I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque for £ 15 , as soon as possible Yours faithfully
Mind what you tell her ; she can make the worst of it ; gossiping is her favorite leisure activity !
A couple of weeks later , my sister called me when I was at work ; completely devastated and weaping scalding tears , she could hardly pronounce a word .
I could get her to simmer for a second or two then she suddenly sarted shouting uncontrollably : - " Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat " , Olga hurled this at me down the phone .
For activities , my first choise is basketball . I have been playing it since I was nine years old .
My second choise is golf .
However , I could enjoy it , even though I was a biginner , so I would like to practise and have fun at the camp .
As I have told you , I had a chance to help at a concert of Majesty , a local band in which one of my friends played guiter .
At first I just helped setting up the stage ; setting microphones , and tuning guiters .
He explained to me that it was to controll the light .
It was fun practicing how to move the lights and change the lights .
Beside that , I 'm alergic , and that causes me problems when I 'm close to nature .
I 'm quite good at paiting and I play tennis . I 'll be very happy if you can give me a chance to use the camp 's art studio and you 'll be able to prepare some painting materials like oil paints , canvas and bruches for me .
I think the result of that action was marvelous .
Everybody was very suprise that you can create such amazing things , using sizors and paper .
The light on the stage was very bright and very warm which made the scenery very pleasent .
The organisers paid for my acommodation and flight to Ireland .
On the next day I helped them to build the scenary and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening .
In order to know what sort of clothes I have to take , please can you tell me about the normal weather for this periode ?
One of the most important things we have to film is our bycicle classes . Our school is now the best in the country in all ages . We are prest with this . We can show what we do in order to be the best .
It would be good to show the swimming poole , the gim , etc .
And on the other hand we also have a very important museum , and a very beatiful building in the school grounds , bowls them ! !
After that , your restaurant was closed whitout reason .
Introduction : The aim of this report is to summerize the right lessons and activities to be filmed .
Conclution
I have always been interested in visiting other contries .
Below is a summary of the most important relevent points with some recommendations .
The fully equipped computer centre in the main building is extremelly good .
2 . The school arranges an amasing range of activities , such as excuintions , sports and different kinds of trips .
Regarding accommodation , between tents and log cabins , I woul prefer a tent , because I love adventure and also because I can be freer .
I know I will have the chance to do two activities , so I have choosen two from your list : basketball , because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been part of a strong team for three years .
The other one I have choosen is swimming ; for the same reason why I chose basketball .
For exemple , if the shop is full of people , it is not enjoyable , because they will create too much confusion , too much noise with the risk of wasting time .
The last problem I would like to tell you about is about the restaraunt there .
First it helps to make my social life convinient .
To sum it up , as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convinient .
I would like to know with whome I 'll share sach wonderful days with the sports activities .
My Russian friend ivited me to set up an exiting new business .
First of all , in order to our firm purpose I wrote an inventation to my favorite idol - the poet and singer Boris Grebenchekoff .
His one - week concert programme was so succsessful that we decided to invite him else , as soon as the tickets were all sold .
I had a nice expirience as manager too .
I am writting about the letter that I recently received from you , which is about a competition in which I have won the first prize .
About the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin instand of a tent , because it is safer and more confortable .
The two activities that I prefer are Basketball , because I played in my school 's team for almoust a year , and Photography , which is a hobby that I am good at and I have done since I was ten .
People are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easy and familiare . It is one place where you can have lunch or dinner , watch a movie after that , and , if you want , buy something at the shops .
Instand of going to the theather , which is more cultural , or even having a picnic at Ikurapiura park , people prefer spending all their money at shopping centres .
Circle theatre 's Manager : I am writting to you because I felt dissapointed after seeing the musical " Over the Rainbow " .
First the actors who were suppoused to star in this show were not the ones put on stage .
I had a discount ticket , but they refussed it and I had to pay the full price .
Appart from this , the show started forty - five minutes late .
I think these reasons are suficiently to ask for my money back .
She was also concerned about being pregned , but she was afraid to tell John about it .
He could n't belived what Pat had told him , so he broke Pat 's nose .
I am now writting this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure .
Regarding the accomodation , I would prefer to stay in tents because I think it will be closer to nature .
Tennis is my favourate sport .
Shopping is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays .
Try to imagine the scence : twenty or thirty or even more people are in a quel outside the fitting room .
The accomodation that best suits me is the log cabin , as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to having all my belongings in order and packed at all times .
With regard to the activities you offer , it is difficult to choose from such a hugh variety , but I prefer to do those I know better such as climbing .
There are many things that can go wrong in the process of adquiring a product or service .
Hunting on the high street , or the shopping malls for the desired bargain - because we ca n't afford to buy anything otherwise - often becomes a desperate atempt to attain a lifestyle promoted by the new consumerist society .
In the end everything depends on our attitud to life , including shopping .
But even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonaly appear , or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms .
First I did n't accept but finally she conviced me .
I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californiai summer is hot and dry so , because a tent 's wind circulation is better , it would create a confortable coolness .
It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital cashier .
They had a concert in my home town , that 's why the organizators were looking for young people who could speak English .
The staff in that departnent were really friendly and helpful and they were also huge , like giants .
Basicly , I helped them liaise with the local police and get some electronical equipment that they needed .
By the way , I have already been invited to their next concernt .
You said that some discouns were available .
When I went to the reastaure I was really suprised .
In the advertisemen you wrote " your perfect evening out " , that 's very funny .
It helps me when I studie . I can find many things on the Internet or write my compositions on it .
I can find cold water in the refrigarator but 50 years ago they did n't have the refrigarator , so our life is easier today .
I think it depents if you are a man or a woman and now I have to say I am a woman and I enjoy it .
First of all , as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can get to know artists who cames from different countries .
I always prefer to read books that are inusual in some way , because they give me the opportunity to escape from everyday reality .
They are the main characters of that book , and what caracterize them is the violence of their passions .
To make it worse , neither discounts nor restraurants were available that night although they were said to be available .
According to the owener of the restaurant , it was closed because the plugs of some lights were cut off .
However , I think there will be some diffences in the quality and materials of clothes .
Although the appearance such as shape and color will not change so much in fashion .
Some people are in a hurry , others are agressive and most of the others are very stressed .
It is not always like that but we often see such a scene , even though shopping is becoming an entertainement not only for teenagers but also for adults .
Then , the show was meant to start at half past seven and I had to wait fourty - five minutes because it started late .
I am writting this letter to complain about the treatment that we received when we went to the Circle theatre in order to see the musical show " Over the rainbow " , whose actors were Anthony Keens and Tina Truelove .
Indeed , it had a big swimming pool and a beatiful garden .
At first I was irritated that contrary to your announcements no discounts were availlable .
To my greatest disappointement Danny Brooks was not in the show , but his part was played by an actor whose ( lack of ) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement .
yours sincerelly
Technology is essencial to our life , we need it each minute , each second .
Good because you can have acess to a lot of information , and it is bad because the computers are doing people 's work .
We really appriciate your organising a very nice programme , which has been organised by you this time .
In particular the River trip to Greenwich makes us very excited and we are really looking to forwold to this .
We 're looking forwold to your reply .
Invent glass was very eventuly to architect .
Architecuture with use of glass brough us modenism in 1980 .
In the future we can expect to have a new material and it will make our life more confortable and convinient .
It is said that one of the reasons is that a small separete room makes children unsociable and depressed .
Also as producing new electoronic , our home of the future will be more convinient .
In addition I would like to choose singing and photography because I am good at singing and taking photographies .
Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert a lot . Really it was a very intresting experience , particularly when I had to deal with a young group of children from Latin America .
It was increible , because I learnt some Spanish words such as Hello , How are you ? goodbye
, What is your name , house , dog , cat , boy , girls etc . I am very happy that I promed myself that I would learn Spanish this Summer at Huntingdon College .
At the concert they were very susscceful because they were very confident and I helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic .
It seems to me that all these failures were your falt , because you were responsible for the organisation of the show .
However , conserning that I saw the show , I would like to get a 50% refund .
Please reply at your earliest convinience .
That is why I think that modern techology helps me in my daily life .
I have once experienced having been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent dut to heavy rain several years ago .
I would be really greateful if you could send me some information or any relevant brochure .
I 'm writting to you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play on at your theatre .
To begin with , the actor you publised as going to perform , did n't .
People are getting more and more adicted to this , because it helps to make everyday life easier and more confortable .
I 've recently been to one of your musical shows called " Over the rainbow " at the Circle theatre in London , thinking it might be a good idea but it was desappointing .
I 'm writting this letter to explain to you what happened and to look for a solution .
To begin , the organitzation of your collegues in the theatre was awful for various reasons .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so without want I knew that there was going to be a concert in owr city given by , from my point of view , the best group in the world , Oasis .
At first I got more angry with Pat than with my other friends in the group , becouse Pat was and is my best friend .
Then I realised that she had reason . I was irritable becouse my parents were going to get divorced , but Pat would always be my best friend so I told her that I was n't angry with her and I was not going to go to the concert becouse I had to go to the court to solve my parent 's affair .
And that 's the story of how I missed the oportunity to go to the only concert that Oasis have given in my city .
Well , some people would say yes whereas others would desagree .
However , I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate what they write in order to respect other people 's privacy ; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed !
I was boried , so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going .
I would prefer to be accomodated in a log cabin as I do not like sleeping on a mattress and I get an allergy to rubber .
Could you , please send me some extra information regarding the ammount of money I should take to cover any other expenses , and also , what kind of clothes I should take .
For the two activites that I chose are at first swimming . I am in the swimming team and I must go two times per week to entretain because I have a competition every weekend .
Could you tell me approximatively how much ?
The concert sarted at 6:00 pm until 2:00 am , and I started to work at 12:00 pm to prepear the stage with the musicians .
After that , at 2:00 pm , when people arrived , I was at the entrance to take the tickets and , you know , it was incredibale because some people slept all night in front of the stadium to be in the front row .
I saw old people , children .... and for me it was very strange and it was very interessting , because I met a lot of people and the best thing was that I knew the pop group who sang . It was fantastic .
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show which the Circle Threatre is staging . I recently had a week 's holiday in London and during my stay I went to your threatre to see " Over the Rainbow " .
In the advertisment , I had read that Danny Brook was starring but he was not .
The play should have started at 19.30 but it started forty - five minutes later , we were waitting there without anything to do .
After the show had finished , I went to the theatre restaurand to hav something to drink and relax but it was closed because the staff was on holiday .
Moreover the discounts were not available as you said in the advertisment and I paid £ 20 .
I would like a refand because it was one of the worst evenings of my life . If this matter is not resolved , I will take it further .
Everybod agreed with her .
I 've recived your letter and I 'm very happy to know that I won the competition and the first prize .
In answer to your question , I will have to say that I can only go to the campament in July because of my job ; they only gave me that month off .
I would prefere to do some climbing because that 's what I do in my spare time and I do it quite well .
Apart from that , if you give surfing classes I would love to take them ; surfing is one of my chilhood drems that never came true .
I do n't know what tipe of clothes I have to take or the amount of money that I 'm going to spend , so if you , please , could help me by giving me this information I would be very pleased .
Shooping is not always enjoyable .
We have all been shooping once in our lives and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable , why ? We had a class discussion and we all agree on some points .
For example , if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we are looking for , and instead of buing what we came for we will leave with lots of things that we liked but we will never use .
Most of the time he gets lost , or they start plaing around , making noise , bothering people , etc ... And when this happens you get in a bad mood and you 'll have a bad day shopping .
So if you want to have a good , relaxing day shopping , we recommend you do n't go with your little brothers and to go with enogh time to look arround for what you really want .
I 'm writting to you because I went to the International Arts Festival and it was a pleasure .
On the other hand , I must tell you that some concert halls are too small , so you ca n't be comfortable enough to apreciate the event .
Considering the advertisement , which appeared in one of London 's newspapers , I would like to present you with some of my complaines about your musical spectacle .
Secondly , the time when your musical should start was changed , delaying your show for nearlly one hour !
Neither the beautiful surranding near your theatre nor the comfortable seats compensated for my horrible evening .
However , technology has a bad influence on us - generally on our healf .
However , he did not act , and his sustitute was not very good at acting .
I went to buy the tickets but when I paid there was not any discount avaible .
That wendsday Pat phoned me and told me that Sally also loved Paul .
The weekend came and that Friday we went to the dyscoteque .
When Sally came out of the dyscotheque I was very angry and I started to shout at her .
Unfortunately I was very disappointed with it ; I was expecting the opposit .
First of all , the advertisement where you advertised your show and what the theatre provides is totaly wrong .
I came to see my favorit actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but the actors whom I saw were other people .
Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy tickets and when I apeared in front of the ticket desk I found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the real price were n't the same , the real price was much higher .
Also the show started very late compared to what was writen in the advertisement .
befor the beggining ?
So , after all of that , I wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant . I was very angry when I apeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice that the restaurant was n't open .
In fact I am writing to you with just one main aim . I 'll be really delighted to resive the money back for my ticket .
I 'm looking forword to hearing from you .
Faithfuly yours
Look at the history books for 400 - 600 years ago , or even for the time of the First and Second World Wars , to see how sociaty has changed , just because we stepped up the advance of science and technology .
On the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medisent for different illneses , but on the other hand they discovered many illneses which we had n't heard about before .
More and more people die from some illnesses whereas a long time ago fewer people died from the same illneses , dispite the fact that they had fewer medisent .
However , technology nowerdays has improved so much and it has changed our lives a lot .
Today we ca n't even think how we could possibly live without computers or without airplanes .
The computer is our way of communicating with the outside world , whereas with airplanes we can reach our parents and friends easily and much faster than we would if we used boats or trains .
Every day scientists and technologyst discover and produce more and more new things and that is good . It has to be like that , we have to go forword not backward from the point where we are now .
Society has to go forword not to stop in one place .
Actually , I read the advertisment for the show and there were a few mistakes in it .
After the play , we wanted to eat at the theater restaurant but we could n't .
As you can see , there are some ( deliberate ? ) mistakes in the advertisment you made .
I quickly became bored by this hypocrital attention they gave me .
I am writting to complain about a musical show last weekend when I was in London .
I felt very upset about your advertisement was totaly different from the musical show .
It was quite rediculous !
She enjoyed sharing everthing with Pat , whatever it was .
This made Nick very embrassed and he felt hurt .
Finally , they got seperated .
For example , if Diana , who was the ex - wife of Prince Charles , had n't been followed by paparachi when she was dating a man , there would n't have been a car accident which caused her death .
It was a pitty that the halls used for the classical concerts were too small .
When the sons were old they began to talk about their life , beginning with this story , which happend a long time ago .
17th Juni 2000
I 'm in London for the first time and I wondered what is interesting on your stage : I read in the newspaper the advertisment about the best musical show .
In the advertisment the cast was very interesting - Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
I desided to go to your theatre but at the beginning it was the tranbles .
In the advertisment it said - " discounts available " .
I 'm a teacher and in Polan I have discounts but in England I do n't . I know this is another country .
I was very suppresed when I saw a different actor . It was n't Danny Brook .
I saw one week ago on TV ( the 23rd annual ) the fashion show in Paris and I was very surrprised because of the style .
All the models had very strange long shoes made from black leather , the trouses were quite short and the jackets were elegant with blazzend materiell .
People will wear clothes made from natural materials like silk , which will be comfortable and elgant .
Because the world is now a global village people will wear at least one item of traditional or national clothing ( for example a peasnt jacket or hat ) , like they do now in rural areas from time to time .
Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you can not control the atmospherical conditions .
When you ask to , the sales person offen answers that your size is out of stock .
It seems like a good oportunity to practise it .
I would rather stay in a tent , because I have stayed in tents before and I liked it . It is more pleasent than staying in log cabins and it is such a wonderful experience .
I agree that shopping is not always ejoyable because a lot of things can happen to you .
Therefore she had to do a lot of tramits to cancell her credit cards and to change her plane ticket .
Well , regarding the accomodation at Camp California I would prefer staying in a tent .
Well this is abosolutly true , espacially when you go shopping on Saturday .
For exemple , you go into a clothes shop , you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt , so they are looking everywhere , pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want .
You get headaches , you get stressed , and finally you get bruses because of the woman who pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you ! ! !
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent , because I find it more confortable to sleep in a bed , but it would n't be a problem if I have to sleep in a tent .
I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never praticed before . That means I do not have any experience .
The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthly for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people .
I have just recieved your letter saying that I have won the competition . I must say I was really surprised and happy to be given the oportunity to join the Camp for two weeks .
I am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities , while I am there . Because of my studies , I will take painting , as this is the subject which I am finishing at college , allways with important cualificaitons , and photography which has been my hobby since I discovered that I can mix , in practice , paint and photography .
Concernet acomodation ,
I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or on an excurcion it is n't the same if I sleep in a cabin .
I really liked one of them concernent a holiday in Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included , for only £ 250 .
I went inside to ask about that package but they told me that it was gone , so , I went to many shoops just to get the same answer .
As and advise try to go shopping in the out pick hours , and do n't waste your time asking for promosion advertised in the windows of the shop .
I 'm not really a young man and during the recent years of my life I becamehave become accostomed to comfort .
That was cruel , because I was very haungry after the show .
In spite of this , I have got all the equipement I need for painting and I paint very well .
The food was deligious and fortunately I did not have to pay for it .
I am very pleased to be the winer in your competition .
When I was at the Univercity I was very keen on basketball and I played for the university team .
In 1998 we were the champion of the First National Leque .
Novadays our shopping habits seem to have changed . I can clearly remember my childhood and our only local shop .
I was really astonished by all these shopping centers , like ASDA , HOMEBASE , etc .
One day I decided to go to the shopping center which is only 40 metres from our house .
I 'd walked arround for about 15 minutes until I found the door .
When I entered the shope I was a bit angry .
In fact , this activity seems to be very interresting .
Unfortunately , I have never practiced but I feel like trying it .
The best thing to do would be to show the cooking personnal because they are very nice .
I advise finishing with a chemistry lesson so that people see the laboratery .
The advertisment promised us a perfect evening but it was n't , so I would highly appreciate it if you could completely refund our tickets .
Since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London , he told Pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new misterious lover .
I 'm writting to you to complain about the musical that I saw when I went to the theatre during my holidays in London .
To my surprise Danny Brook never apeard .
He is my favorite actor and I paid to see him not to see a different actor .
Finally at the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it had n't been repeard .
I enclose my postal addresses and I will be looking forward to a completly refund
Most of them believe that they are kind of crazy or ievel .
Carol , a 16-year - old girl , said , " I imagine clothes in the future will be very strang .
Maybe they will be in many colors and they will be very thight .
They will be sinthetic clothes , I think , made of plastic or something similar . "
Most young people like Carol believe the same and use their minds to imagin the variety of clothes in the future .
After all , they 'll be the ones that dicide what the Fashion of the Future will be like .
My name is Joseph and I am writing this letter to complain about the mess that the adimnistration of the Circle theatre presented to me .
We paid to see Danny Brook , my son 's favorite actor , but we were quite disappointed . My son was very happy because he would see his favourite actor for the first time .
Expecting British pontuality , we went to the theatre at 19:00 to wath the 19:30 show but it only started at 20:15 . It finished later than it was suposed to and then we missed the train .
I did n't see any discounts available ; I thought my son would have paid less than I. As we had alredy missed the first we went to the theatre restaurant , which is famous for its good food , however , it was closed .
Because of this , the least you can do for us is to give me my money back and work hard so that this theater , which is famouis for its beauty and pontuality does n't become famous for its desorganized shows .
People have seen in the last 10 years how diferent our clothes can become .
Clothes used to be made of coton , but nowadays we can see shirts , pants , socks .... made of almost anything .
Computers are little things nowadays , but at the speed at which tecnology develops , in the next century clothes will tell our doctors about our healt at any moment , any time , anywhere , people will be able to locate us arround the world .
In the future we wo n't buy clothes according to size or even color . Our clothes will adapt to our bodies , the weather , our fit , all our needs .
I saw the musical show in your advertisment during my holiday .
I think after 100 years , at least something will change as regards design , material , color , etc .
Since I was a child , I have been intrested in camping and sleeping in tents .
For exemple , how much pocket money will be enough and what kind of clothes I should wear .
We think that this is a great opportunity and we are all very interested in going because we can see there the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , a lot of different kinds of make - up and some famous hairstylers .
The show is absolutly free for students .
I have further ideas . In the futur , maybe in 2113 , there will be houses like now but with more technical things .
But I think that people will altough need a bed and a table with a chair .
houses will only be more modern and more practique but not very different from our homes in the present .
The whole show and the acting was of a standard comparable to scholl theatre .
When we decided to visit the theatre Restaurant after the show it was clouse because some decorating was n't finished .
It was this last poin that got me angry .
After evrything that had happened we went to the hotel tipped and very affect .
From a small village to the town was a very long way becouse people used a horse and wagon .
Evry family now has a TV , to travel long distances we use not just the car but elso the train and airplain .
Before we had a phantasy about how people might travel to other planets , and what we see now is a spaceship cruising in space .
Before it was only in our emegination .
New techology has made our lives more comfortable and esee .
Evrything that we do now we do with a computer : it helps to look after the house , to perform very difficult operations , becose the computer can think much faster than a human .
And I can continue my list in this way ... becouse science never stops in one place .
Looking forward to your repply .
It was such a wonderful experiece !
When Jane asked me to help her with the publicity and specially with the inverviews , I just could n't believe it .
You know that I love going to concerts , but being at the beging of the show and a member of the staff was something I was always interested in .
In the area of publicity we were about 50 guys , all of us investigating , calling radio stations , organizing the reporters , specifying where the press would be for the interview that took place afterwards ... yet , it was incredibly satisfation when everything turned out just fine !
Before I go to the Camp , I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and wheather there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies .
I was one of the lukiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town .
Me and my friends were very excited , not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we would be able to see !
However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practicing on the stage .
He started to consum the stuff at the age of twenty .
He had problems at home because his mother wanted to settle down in Australia , but Peter was used to living in New York , where it is overcrowded and he was surronded by people .
But I have booked a flight home at the beginning of Auguest .
Nowdays the Internet brings us closer and closer .
3 . Liabrary .
We not only borrow books from a liabrary but also study at a liabrary .
With reference to the accomodation I would rather stay in a tent because I think it is the best way to socialize .
In addition I need to know whether meals are included or not with the accomodation so that I can decide how much I must have with me .
Just then Ake exlaimed that I could play the piano .
yours sinicrely
The restaurant , which I decided to visit after the show to eat something , was closed without any explaination and the perfect evening was completely unperfect .
Often you wear very litte but short skirts and tops .
The sommers and winters get warmer .
Besides all those improvements and confort I ca n't stop thinking where all this will lead us .
All these items of equippments are applications of modern science .
Thank you for this prize , I 'm really ecited and emotional .
To answer your reguest , I would like to travel only in July because
I really apreciate this kind of trip and I 'm really grateful for your attention .
Yours sincirely ,
Women ca n't resist the temptation of shopping and they are dissapointed when they do n't have the desire to shop .
Shopmania is really unstapped . I know women who do everything they can to buy only a dress , or even worse , women who buy things they have no use for , for example , snap , esculptures , kitchen tissues , or eveything sold by telemarketing that really is unuseful , but they can not resist the fact of it " being there . "
There are many facts to prove that shopping is not " pretty and armonious " , so believe me , it is not always enjoyable .
I am writing to you becaus I was very disappointed with the show you have put on to attract people to come to your theatre .
First of all , I came to see the play just becaus my faivourite actrice shoud have been in it , but she was n't .
The time of the evening performance on the tiket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15 , which forced visitors to stay in one plase for 45 minutes , a waste of time .
The ticket discounts were not available under any subconstanses and the theatre restaurant was closed .
I strongly recomand you to pay a minimum 50% of the full price that I paid .
Your faithfull
I think that in 100 years from now , the clothes fashion will be totaly different .
In my apineon the world itself will be different in temperature as a result of global warming , also people will become nicer , less this will take place , so the clothes will mainly be made from cotton with smooth colours like dark grean or gray .
They will be comfotable clothes becaus the main point for any caind of clothing is to be comfatable .
Also there will be no leather or fethers used in maiking these clothes becaus by that time the animal population will have fallen and Green pease will be very strong , much stronger and more pouful than it is now .
So we can imagine the Future Fashion might be pleasent or unpleasent for different people .
The styles will be more or less the same as each other and everyon will be setisfaid with them .
I am writting to reply to your letter and comenicate my aceptance of the first prize in your Competition .
This summer , I am available in July because in Agust my family and I are going to go to Canada and in September I will go back to university .
If there is no chance to go to California in July , I could wait untill next summer .
About accommodation , I would like to have a log cabin because last year I had an accident and my back was enjure , so sleeping in a tent would be painful for me .
Due to my back enjure , this year I could not train and play with my team , so I am not fit . It would be a good aidea to be a referee .
Althoung swimming is so boring , it would be a good thing to help cure my back .
Could you please let me know where I will eate ? If there will be a vegetarian menu ? And how much is it ?
And please could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes I will have to bringh ?
It was a hard month because my job was very hard . I worked 12 hours per day but alwalys with fun people .
I 'm writting this letter to complain about the musical show I saw during my stay in London .
If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and whereever he is I will be able to get through to him .
I 'm extremly happy because not only do I earn a lot of money but also I 'm learning a lot .
I 'd like to travell in July because I 've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July .
And I 'd like to stay in a log cabin because I ca n't bear sleeping in a tent . I hate that kind of accomodation .
I have recently recieved your letter saying that I have won the first prize in the competition .
It was very fortuanate for me .
Please could you send me an itenerary of the trip ?
I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people , especially at the weekends , which normally is the only appropreaite time !
Danny Brook was meant to be the starring actor but he wasn not , another actor took his place .
In the advertisement you say that there is a biscount available but there was not .
I think the next time you write an advertiment you should put in the right information .
I did not have a perfect evening with so many proplems .
Yours fouthfouly
Does technology have a bad or a good efection ?
In the 18th cetury , technology started to grow more and more and the 20th century was called the century of technology .
Thechnology helps people .
It informs people , hospitals use modern technogoly , and the computer helps staders and helps people do their job .
A lot of countries buy gans , for their defence they say , but they buy them to kill people .
Technogoly ca n't ever stop going forward , and so people always go farward but with the same effection of modern techology .
In the advertisment you promised a perfect evening out , but it was n't .
It was very disappointing for me that the actor was n't Danny Brook , as was promised in the advertisment .
So I want to ask for my money back , also I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisment .
But are they usefull in every situation and everywhere ?
My oppinion is that modern technology can help you to save time .
But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the resaurant after the show .
If I search for something like a telephone number or an adress I also look it up on the Internet .
Another important point for me is that things like listening to music or watching TV sound better and the pictures on TV are being impoved , because the machines become better .
The third problem was that it was writting that discounts were available , but when I got there it was not true .
For example , a car , which is used by everyone every day , changed my daily life in the sense that I do n't need my dad or my mum to go ice - skating or to go to work . I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of technology , but because I can show that I am responsable .
In spite of the fact that the weathe is bad , I play tennis .
In addition speaking activity includes everything for learning English such as listening , speaking , and grammer as well .
In other lessons , the teacher teaches lots of things which are grammer , English culture ... etc .
I play the classicial guitar and I also sing . I have been playing the classicial guitar for three years .
I wonder if you could tell me about the wheather and what kind of clothes I ought to bring with me .
It was very ashameful for my mum .
You also mentionned the activities I 'll be able to do .
Althoug I 've been playing tennis for five years , I ca n't say I 'm a very good player .
Firstly , the story takes place in South Africa , during the period of Appartheid .
I think that you ca n't understand all the links between the events whitout reading the book more than once .
Moreover , once I was paying for the tickets , I found another thing out : there were no discounts avaible .
I had to go back to the hotel , because all the restaurants in the area were absolutelly crowded .
Summing up , you might have realised that that was n't " my perfect evening out " wich you promised , so I would like you to give me the money I paid for the ticket back .
She works as a model , and she was advicing him about what clothes , etc , ... to buy for her .
I decided to go to a play at the theatre of wich you 're the manager to see " London 's newest and best musical show . "
The principal reason I 'm writting to you at the moment is that I want my money back , because I felt so disappointed with the theatre and also with the play .
Before modern technologies arrived , you could n't comunicate as easily as we can do today .
You can comunicate with people in places where you would never imagine going to because it would be too expensive .
But , if you do n't like using the keyboard to say something or to communicate , you can use video conferencing , a sistem wich lets you talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers .
The modern technologies mean I am able to listen the music I 've downloaded with the same quality as a CD , and if I buy a reproductor , I can carry this music everywere .
Also computers and mobile phones have evolutioned thanks to modern technologies .
As far as accomodation is concerned , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable , and , therefore , I have never stayed in a tent .
To sum up , it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study , but it should concern their sportif activities as well .
On that date , I decided to spend one evening seeing a musical show as I was on holiday in London and was interested in the musial show .
I found the theater rather noisy as I arrived very early to sit in the front row .
However , something wrong occurred again . The actor ' Danny brook ' , whom you advertised in the brocher , did not play a part in the show .
I am not satisfied with your show as it was compeletly different from the advertisement .
It 's comletely different !
Have you ever been to a fashion show named " New trend , New Millenium " ? '
How can we go out wearing thouse clothes ? '
On the other hand , some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so they prefre to wear nothing .
In fact , unlike the perfect evening out that you promised in your advertisement , I had a very disapointing evening .
There were also the discounts wich were n't available .
Can you imagine how exsiting it is when we are in the dark and very quiet and we can hear the sound of the animals .
I have been doing a lot of them when I have had some free time and when I feel empressted with where I have been .
Fainally I would like to ask you about I have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because I will pack the clothes as usedful .
It was brillian .
You know , you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in they could n't weait to get to the frount and they try to go through very quickly .
So you have to explain a lot of times to make people clamed down and stand in a row .
Appart from that , here is the information that you asked me for :
- About the accomodation , as I read , you can offer me a log cabin or a tent .
That 's so good when you have the money to enjoy it but , appart from that , there are many problems .
Also there is a big problem : the mony .
Secoundly , I would be very grateful if you could accommodate me in tents rather than log cabins .
From the list of activities in which I will have a chance to compete I have choosen basketball and swimming .
But , is n't it a kind of entertaintment ?
For example , emagine that you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate outfit .
I am writing this letter to complane about the Circle Theatre .
Secondly discounts were not availabe .
What 's more , the theatre reastaurant was closed when the show finished , because the show started at 20:15 .
It was not a perfect evening whatoever .
Everything will be usefull and combinient , even fashion .
The most important thing will be your fugure , such as long legs or pear - shaped .
Traditional or Comtemporaly
In concrution , the clothes will be more interesting than now for everybody .
I 'm used to sleeping in a tent from my previous holidays and I always injoyed it .
I actually injoyed it working there and I would n't hesitate to work there again .
The activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting . I chose to play baskelball ( I play in a club , I am quite good ) and to do photography ( there must be beautiful pictures to take in California ) .
You asked me which accomodation I would prefer .
Moreover , the admittion fee is free for students .
In addition to this you will be able to control all parts of the house by computer such as temperature or vacume cleaning .
About the accomodation , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I have a bad back and I think that sleeping in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me .
Let us then ask : ' Is this activitie always enjoyable ? '
Far from the strengh that doing a sport or even going to work requires , going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier ; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money .
However , this apparently quiet and relaxed activitie can sometimes turn into a living hell ; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then , if you do go , you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people , unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy with the mixture of smells that come from the people .
On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping is not a difficult activitie , it is also true that it is definetly not an enjoyable one .
I received your letter this morning and I was very suprised by it .
I am writting to you about your questions .
First , I can come there only in July because of my examination , I have to take it in June , and my new turm will also start in September .
My main work was to take people to their seats because of a concert hall , which was the millenium dome .
I also sold a panfulet of that concert , CD and T - shirts .
I told you before Elton John performed at that concert , so there were a lot of famouse people .
She was abusolutelly beautiful .
I 'm pleased to receive your letter and realy happy that I won the first prize .
July is also good because the wethear is warm and I could enjoy the time I will spend in the camp more .
I think I can handde it very well .
I 've choosen Photography because I love to take pictures !
if I have to take any special equipement for the activities that I 've chosen
Whether there is a phone , a fax or e - mail so I can be in touch with my familie .
Yesterday was Valentine 's day here in Portugal . In particurely I had to spend it alone ... again .
I 'm writing to you to tell you about a pop concert that happend here in São Rafael .
Red Hot Chilli Pepers came here for a short time and they played at the " Chedicard Hall " .
It was realy cool because I did some backstage work .
I was everywher .
I took lots of pictures , asked for authographs and I even gave them my cel phone number !
They promissed me that they would call me someday , which I particulary doubt .
I hope you answer this letter as quik as possible with lots of thing to tell me .
Dear Manager : I am Angela Ounis and I am writting to you because I went to see ' Over the Rainbow ' , London 's newest and best musical show .
Also it was said that Discounts would be available , but I did n't receive any discount as you were cheating us . I know that you have a big responsability but if you have told something to people , stick to it .
I have learned a lot with the Internet . It gaves me the opportunity to know more about things I never knew about .
I had n't tought about a restaurant to go to after the show , because if the advertisement had been right , there should have been a luxury restaurant where I could eat .
Yours Sinceraly
We are in the age of technologic development , of that there can be no doubt .
First of all , we would like to say thank you very much for organising our tour around London and our programme , wich is considered especially good for us because of the places we will visit .
Secondly , we saw last Saturday in the Oxfor News an advertisement about the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to know if it would be posible to inclued this show in our tour .
The show is going to take place in the Gernal Exhibition Hall in London , Thursday the 14 of March , so it could be a good idea to see this show intead of going to the Science Museum .
We think that it could be a great opportunity because in one day we can see everything concerning fashionable clothes , new make - up and hayrstyles .
In this letter you ask me for some further information for my conveniance for this trip .
I received your letter , which says I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I apreicate that and I thank you sincerely for having chosen me as a winner .
I acxepted and I want to inform you that I can travel only in July because I have booked my anual leave for that period .
I helped them to prepare the room for the bads and I decorated the place for the singers .
It took a long time to testifite the speakers and the microphones .
The audients was excited and I can not discribe my happyness .
I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompaning our songs .
I am writing to you to give you some requiered information .
As you can see , I have abosolutly no experience in it .
During my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show and unfortunatly I had a very disappointing evening .
Lastly , about the ticket . The advertisment said ' Discouts Available ' but no way , I had to pay the full £ 20.00 and the restaurant was closed because of rebuilding or something .
However , the point that I am trying to make is that you just ruined my hoilday .
Your advertisment was unfair .
As you are a manager , you have resposbillity for justifying this problem . and I have a right to get fair treatment as a costomer .
But I say fashion is Artistic insperation which is expressed by fabric and all sorts of material .
As I said before , fashion is somehow influenced by science and insperations that we get from all sorts of enviroment .
These days we are very intrested in space and the millenium and things and many designers have shown millenium looks recently .
I expect human beings will live on other planets and trevel around under the sea .
I think people will wear those spacy and cyber - looking clothes after a centry .
Can you imagin you and your friends going on a picnic to the Moon with a silvery skirt with Astronut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots ?
It could be more facinating .
Swimming is my favourite way of excercise and keeping fit .
THIRDLY , I WAS VERY EMBARASED TO DISCOVER THERE WERE NO DISCOUNTS AT THE ENTRANCE .
I always have a positive approach with all of the most recent invenctions or any other kind of modern appliance .
Anyway , the thing that has changed my daily life most is the personal computer and , expecially , the Internet .
Also , the times printed in your advertisment were 14.30 and 19:30 .
In your advertisment , it said that discounts were available for the tickets .
I was rather thirsty and hungry after the show and your advertisment made a cup of tea and some cakes in your restaurant sound rather inviting .
It was not my ' perfect evening out ' , as your advertisment said it would be , and I would like some money back .
It 's a natural reaccion to be angry with somebody you do n't trust for gossiping about you and bothering your personal thoughts .
But they do n't consider the problems the romours may cause the famous family or couple .
In conclusion , no matter what the journalit 's aims are , famous people deserve to have their problems , their affairs , their private lives just as normal people do .
I saw your advertisment for your show at the circle theatre , over the rainbow .
Also it was written in the advertisment that some discounts were available , but there were n't any discounts .
First she said to her father , then to her mother and finally to her brother , that I was from another planet called Orion , that was a billion kilometer from Earth and then I was so ashamed because I have been her boyfriend since I came to Earth .
I would like to thank you for chossing me .
I am good at Basketball and tenis .
At university I atend tennis lessons for two years .
Finaly I would like to ask you .
As I told you two months ago , I saw the advertisment in the newspepper .
Just before the consert I had to check that everyone was present .
The consert was briliant .
It was terrible ! We had a lot of problems from the beggining .
Everything was all right during the band 's performance , but at the end some espectators came up on the stage and did some damage to the band 's instruments .
As you can see , hardly anything went well , but the lights and the sound - for both of wich I helped carry things - were appropriate for the concert .
Firstly , it was written in the advertisment that there would be stars and artists from around the world . I believe that it 's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
That was excelent because it attracted people 's attention .
regarding the accomodation , I would prefer a log cabin . I think that will be safer for all my things .
The stage was gigantesque . The crowd could be all around .
I mean , it 's still inbelivable . Can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking their hands .
Your advertisement was excellent and it gave me a lot of enthousiasm .
Then , I think it 's interssant to answer the following question :
This little essay shows that I depend on technology and , moreover , because I 'm in an electronic eegenering school , I 'm keen on technology .
I pressume if the term becomes longer the festival will become better .
I can say the actions which are prohibitted at school are no problem at home .
We think that it is a great opportunity because it is just once per year and it is free for stundents .
We stayed at my aunt 's house which was in the center of the village .
I loocked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine .
The policeman came to take the bugglar and thanked me for catching him .
The concerts and the dance show were incredable , except for the classical concert that was in too small a hall .
Secondly , the plays and films were very well organized despide the low numbers .
The art exhibition showed us a new lifestyle and society that was totaly different from ours .
The talks by writers were very tecnic but they could be understood by all the people who were at the festival .
In conclusion , I was impresed by all the good organisation , the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events .
The price was excelent because there was n't any time limit .
I hope that you organice this festival for all the coming years .
At school you are n't allowed to bring in connected movil phones although there is more than one student that does .
Teachers will take it from you if it rangs during school hours .
If you break one of these rules you could be expulsed for a week , a month or for ever .
As well will have the responsability of looking after my brother when they are n't at home .
In answer to your question , I would n't change anything because I think that these are the minimum rules that a theenager has to have to be responsable in the future .
I would be very grateful if you could give me some aditional information .
When she finished the sound check , I went to meet her . I told her I was very happy to be there and to have helped at the concert , and I asked her for an authograph .
I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph .
When I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement , but they were not avaible .
Despite this I was still excited about the show , but then I sudently realised that Danny Brook was not performing , he had been replaced by an extremely disappointing actor .
I 'm writing to you about our trip which you have orginesed .
Sincerally ,
They nead to be with their family in peace .
In fact on the stage appeared a compleatly different person .
But to make everything clear I 'll start from the beggining .
Our parents were very pleased and happy we were so ambisious .
As a result we were grouded for all the holidays and all because of our almost perfect Pat .
And what belter way to solve this than to give the festival an international character .
If you like fishing , you can try to colaborate with the local market or some shops , in order to sell them the fish you catch yourself .
I prefer to stay in a cabin because I have never been on holiday in a tent before , so I think it is more corfotabel to sleep in a bed instand of outside in a tent .
The activities I would like to do durring these two weeks are basketball and swimming .
I think I can play basketball well , because a few years ago I was a mamber of the scool team .
Swimming is not my favorite sport but I prefer swimming to golf or tennis .
Please could you informy me what you meen when you say all the accommodotion is paid for : is that including food and drinks , so that I know how mutch money I have to bring with me , and what kind of wather it is during this period of the year so that I know what kind of clothes I have to take .
I was the assistent of the person responsible for the clothes and make - up of the pop group . Really I was very nervous about that because it was my first time with such famous people , but I am very happy that all the things went very well . Kim , what I realy particularly liked was when I was asked to do the make - up on my own . Really I was very nervous but at the same time very happy , but everything went well and everyboby was very hapy with my work .
Realy I think you have to try to do the same thing next summer , I realy enjoyed it .
You ca n't go outside in peace , and there is always a crownd of people who stand in front of your house waiting for you .
We have seen it in an advertisment and I would like to go to the show .
It is a great opportunity for us because the fashion is fashinating and free .
For example , we would be able to put off our visit to the science museums on Thusday morning till Wednesday afternoon .
The fashion show starts at 10 oclock and finishes at 7 o'clock .
Journalists follow famous people , such as politicians and film stars , in order to take fotos and get information about them .
I think that it is very dangerous because the famous peple can not have a private life and consequently they may suffer from deppresion and sadness , which may lead them to suicide .
I think that the goverment have to protect them and their private life from the journalists , by punishing journalists .
I am writing to complain about the Musical ' Over the Rainbow ' , permormed at the Circle theatre last week .
What was suppoused to be a perfect evening out turned out to be a disappointing one instead .
If I want to know how a friend is , I just have to phone him ; I can see how the world is getting on just by switching on the television , and I can cook in a few minutes using the Microvelle oven .
In conclussion , I think that technology has two faces which affect my life as well as everybody else 's life .
As far as accomodtion is concerned , I would like to live in a tent at Camp California .
I prefer this type of accomodation because I am used to living in tents during my summer holidays .
Concerning the accomodation , I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin , because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience I had in Ireland because of the weather ...
But so far I have only taken pictures on holiday and of some family celabrations .
Otherwise I had to keep walking untill the train started .
I was sitting under a full - bloomed cherry blossam tree .
Their hobies were listening to the radio , reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything .
The performances were great , but some halls were too small to accomodate all the people who were there that day .
So , in the daytime , we can focus on our studyings .
George was about to be linched on account of his skin colour .
The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisonner .
No one was garding him .
One of the reasons that I have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays . In the future , I hope to be an actress and that 's why I want to learn something from the professionalists .
They want too much forstudent and are unkind to them .
I 'm writting to you to answer the letter in which , as you probably know , you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that camp .
I 'm writting to you to tell you how much I enjoyed last Saturday .
It was such a beautiful night ! Unforgetable .
I had always dreamt of being near " The Cranberies " , but I had never thought that the dream could become reallity .
During the afternoon , Tim and I spent the hours before the concer lying in the park next to the sports hall where the concert was to be held .
After a few minutes the dream happened : Kare - the guitarrist - appeared over there .
Finally he said how grateful he was and alowed us to stay with them till the concert started .
As far as accomodation is concerned , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
I have been travelling every summer since I was eighteen years of age and this type of accomodation is part of the ritual .
Thanking you in advance , I am looking forward to your prompt respons to my questions .
I went as a voluntier in order to go for free .
The accomodation and the food were part of the contract ... everything free .
I met lots of nice cool people , and what I most enjoyed was the crazy atmospher of the whole thing .
The best thing was that I have learned how to take care of their expensive instruments and I have sung my favorite songs with them .
There are so many monuments in California and so I will remember this holiday with my photographies .
Finally I would like to ask you if I need any money , because you say all accomodation and travel costs are paid for .
He also gave me his adress and telephone number if I need help from him in the future .
It continues to develop and always will be the most importand thing in our life .
When I asked something about a " discount " , your staf said that it was impossible .
Becouse my favorite actor appears in it .
We waited for the show to start for about one hour and fourty - five minutes .
During the show , we did n't see Danny Brook , who is my favorite actor .
If Danny Brook does not appear , you have to say something about this to the people who are there in the theater . This is your unforgivable mistake .
After the show , we were still angry . We wanted to eat something in your theater restaurant .
Yours faithfull
Everthing is easy now .
There was n't any discount avaiable for the tickets and I went to the theatre with my three cousins from Brazil .
faithfuly ,
With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access the Internet to comunicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from us .
Besides this , the information goes faster than it used to now and it 's avaiable at the same time in every part of the world .
First of all , in your advertisment for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part in the show .
The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long . And I absolutely agreed with them .
Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't , and also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to eat some thing or to have a drink .
So , the next day Pat went and told his sister Sally that her friends were organising a suprise party for her birthday .
When Sally heard that , she was very suprised and very excited .
But although she was acting like this she was very ungry with her brother Pat , because he did n't keep the secret .
Suddenly they all shouted " suprise ! " .
Sally , although she knew about it , seemed very suprised !
So her friends did n't realise that she knew about the party and they were very happy because they believed that the suprise party had been a success !
It was an unforgetable night ! ! !
I am writing to complaine about the evening at the Circle Theatre presenting " Over the Rainbow " .
Everybody will wear anything he / she likes , choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange .
On the other hand , if human society changes to become stricher and more limited , there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing , formed by the needs of society .
I 'm very sory to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening .
First , I got there at 7:00 pm , because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm , and I needed some time to buy the tickets . I bought two tickets for £ 20 and when I asked for a discount , they did n't give me one , then I was kept waiting for the show to start untill 8:15 pm .
Later when the show finished , I planned to go to the restorant and get some food , but it was closed , because it was being repaired .
I was in love with a friend 's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair , but when I made the big mistake of telling my little and terrible secret to Pat , everithing started going wrong . Katrin , my friend , and the one I was being bad to , was very upset with me , and she was right , but I really did n't know what to do . I was in love with Brett , but I loved my friend too .
Then I decide to talk to Katrin . I was very sory for all I had done , so I apologised to her and promised her that this would never happen again .
Rescently I decided to see Over The Rainbow , a very famous and well - known show .
Furthermore , I was shooked when one of the main actors came onto the stage .
He was n't Danny Brook , one of the resons for my choice of coming to see Over the Rainbow .
A century ago , when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plouge behind them , we 've got the word " time " .
I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role to play , exspecially today when fuel is so expensive .
I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement for the Circle theater said about the musical show called '
Moreover , as I had read the advertisement carefully , I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theater 's restaurant .
So , because of the things I have mentioned , I think I shoul be given some money back .
I look forward to recieving some information from you .
In addition to this , there is less comunication between members of my family , because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time , the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television .
On the other hand , and in conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living sourrended by lots of gadgets with different functions .
In the advertisment for the show you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise there was a different actor , and that realy disapoint me .
Then the show was suppost to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15 , more than half an hour late .
I had read in the advertisment that there were some discounts available but there were n't .
And the theatre restaurant was being pait , so I could not go there .
As you may undertand it was not a perfect night and I was not pleased with the show or eaven with the service .
Tecnology , are we prepeared for these advances ?
Tecnology improves our lives , we have high - tech equipment for cooking , for work , for study , well nearly for everything .
And when we understood the Internet , we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able " to chat " with them was the height of tecnology .
But now we can eaven see the face of the person we are chatting to . The Internet is amaizing .
And now of courese there will be someone trying to improve it .
Tecnology changes our daily life , it makes our life easy to live and of courese more confortable with computers , televitions , radios et cetera and sometimes safer , as with medicine .
Definitly we should try to understand tecnology . If we know how to use it , tecnology will improve our way of life .
When I met Caballos , my best friend , I felt embarassd and disappointed and I could n't say anything .
It is as if they lose their concience while they are shopping .
When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place , all trying to find the best prices and not carying about anybody , this could drive anyone crazy .
The long queues , crowded places , high prices , sales , all these things conbined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it .
So while I am at the Camp I want to take a lot of photographies and climb a mountain .
Shopping sounds very enjobleable and is fantastic for women . You can find a lot of interesting things which were unexpected .
They are also the lessons which English people and other foreigners are particularlly curious about .
This is a good oppertunate to see how they learn in class .
In conclusion , besides all that I mentioned , I highly recommond you video the students ' daily life and interview them .
In fact , now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries , for exemple , in the morning and receive their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing .
Therefore I regard the Internet as quite a powerful tool and I believe it has given more strenght to relationships between people .
I am really glad to receive the first priec in your competition . It will be very plesant joining the holliday .
Regarding your first question , I would like to travel only in July because it is my school holliday so I would not miss any classes .
As regards activities I would choose singing and surfing . Surfing because it is my favourit sport . I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good at it . And singing because I really love it . I am not as good at singing as I am at surfing but I like doing it .
I only had to stay behind the drummer suppling them with water whenever they wanted .
I had a really nice time with them even tought I would've preferred to stay at the front with the other people ,
I hope you 've enjoed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
I received your letter and would be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July because in June I will be in Austria with a friend and for August I have rented an appartment with my family .
You can come across a very disagreable shop assistant and if you find what you wanted , you will not want to pay him or her for it .
There is nothing more disagreable than that .
Further to the umpleasent event that took place last week , it is my right to complain about the musical show I saw when I was in London .
The show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it did not start until 8:15 . Then I felt dissappointed because the main actor had been changed .
If that does not seem enough , after the show my boyfriend wanted to take me to eat something in the theatre 's restaurant but the umpleasent surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday .
I 'm always having holidays in July . It is my favorite time for holidays .
Just the nesseccary .
I think the people who enjoy shopping are greede for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit ( ? ) , in the intelect life .
We must do something to help other people to feel better and be usefull .
It was very interresting , because I did different things .
I took some photographies and I 'll show them to you when you come next week
Dear director of the Circle Theater !
On Friday we , my friend and I , visited your Theater to see ' Over the rainbow ' .
It should have been my best evening that week , unfortunatly it was n't .
Instead of 7.30 am as your advertisment said , it started at 8.15 am .
When the show started Danny Brook was not acting , which was a great dissapointment for us both .
We are both big faan of his
When the show was finished we went to the resturant to have something to eat .
But then it was cloesed for repairs .
Because of all this troubel I think we should have our money back .
And next time , make soure that your advertisment is accurate !
When were nine years old and were in thired grade we had a ' House ' where we used to play all afternones .
In fact it was n't a realy house , it was some stones between the trees in the littel forest neear our house .
It was a secret place and we had promissed each other not to tell anybody about it .
Useally we were cooking flower soup , and swapping secrets .
One day when I was there alone , I heard some other kids aproting . I sat down behind one of the stones so they could n't see me .
One minute later , Pat and half our classe stod in ' the House ' looking and laufing at me and my flower soup .
Maby she did it to make friends .
I do n't want to be rude , but this is not proffessional at all .
Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock ,
So I am asking you : why do you adverstise it if is not going to be available to the audience ?
First , I am very dissapointed about the star .
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO DESCRIBE MY DESAGREABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE LAST SATURDAY , AT YOUR SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
BUT WHAT I CANNOT FORGIVE YOUR COMPANY IS CHANGING THE TIME IT STARTS AT THE LAST MINUTE , MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK 'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISSAPOINTED .
WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED , WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER , AS YOU SUGGESTED IN THE PROGRAMM , BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS ON PUBLIC WORKS ! ! !
Definately the worse .
I would be greatful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us of your decision as soon as possible .
There are people from both sides of the agrument who have strong feelings .
Both of them are my favorite sports and I 'm quite good .
You asked me for some further information and here are my " desirs " :
I stood at the entrance and theire I had to check the tickets .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists fellowing them all the time .
Famous people have always been the center of interest for a number of people .
This show would give us a lot of information about current activities , fashion and what is happening here in London with , for example , the lastest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up , and hairstyles .
If you agree , after the Science Museum , we can have lunch at a restaurant near the musuem , then we can go directly from the restaurant to the Central Exhibition Hall .
It does n't matter who they are , where they come from , what color skin they have .
There will be a numer of Developments in Technology in the future , which could make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is the feeling of being together and love .
Therefore , I hope that you can agree to a suitable arguement between you and me .
I started trainning in 1996 , and I have never given it up .
There are more and more retailors opening .
I could n't believe my luck . I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Meditarenian Sea .
Thirdly , the person on stage was very strenge to me , because I expected to see " Danny Brook " , but I did n't .
Althoug modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living , can it give you nature , peace and fresh air ?
Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment , or I should say angry , better sad . I would never have expected that I could be so decepted .
This is not the firt time I have been to your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays , but be sure " Over the rainbow " will be the last one .
As I am specially fond of musicals , I even travel abroad to see what 's new , I am probably one of your most devoted customers . I know this word is not the best but you have demostrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business .
Of course , you shoud give a refund for the money spent , not only to me but to all the audience .
New fabrics create new textures , all kinds of accesories are added to create new versions , to refresh old ideas , to make new proposals that will last , as always , just a few weeks .
Have you noticed that all the classic gentlemen wear the same tipe of suit ?
And what about those kinds of intellectual and progressive people , do n't they all wear the same type of ugly but confortable shoes ?
I am sure that fashion will survive for ages , it will even change to become easier to use and cleaner , because we all need to feel a part of our society , comunicate our way of living and thinking , be part of a group and , at the same time , be different .
- When the musical finished I was terribly hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisiment said that it would be open .
Modern technology has changed my life in many difents ways :
To summarize , the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things wich would be impossible in the past but also creates many problems .
As I was so looking foreward to seeing Danny 's performance , I was very disappointed .
It is a very good shedule , especially because you have considered different activities for us .
Personally , I think it could be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attent , and we are all interested in the latest fashion .
We discussed the programme , and because the show will take the whole day , we would not mind going to the Science Museum on Wenesday instead of having free time all afternoon .
I did n't even think of boking down .
The clock was running .. tick , tac ... And suddenly everything stopped .
I felt an enourmous peace .
Fortunatelly , I was n't alone .
Thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this three - day programm in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there , especially in the National Art Gallery .
The thing is that we have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
Futhermore , students can enter free !
Thank you for your attenlion and understanding .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers which will control everything , every item of furiture , light , temperature .
But , on the other hand , people will still have to programm them , as they have to do nowadays .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , cups will be washed automaticly .
IT 'S UNDENYABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING .
IN CONCLUSION , I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN IN THE BEGGINING OF THIS CENTURY .
During these past few decades , or rather in the 20th century , there has been a great deal of developement in modern technology .
One of the essential developement has been in our means of transportation .
Another significant technological developement is the invention of electrical appliances .
Modern technology helps people in many ways and is indespensible .
When the show finished I was eniting to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed .
I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disapointed experience I have ever had .
When I wake up I take a shower using eletricity then I prepare my breakfast in the oven then I go to school by bus , when I arrive at home I put my lunch in the microwave then I watch TV and do my homework using a pen . When I come back from jiu - jitsu I eat something that was cooked in the oven then I go to bed .
About a millenium ago everything was different ; people did n't have electricity , they cooked their food on the fire and they did n't have pens .
Regarding the two activities I have to choose , I decided to choose a new activitie that I have never done before , which is Sailing . I am a total begginer at this .
The other activitie is Photography . I am not an expert , but I know how to use a camera . All I want is to improve my knowledge .
I helped them with organizing the stage , cleaning everything , fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guittars !
I had put some money aside for that month , thinking about the discount , but when I went to buy them they said that discounts were not avaible .
Waiting for your repley .
When she finished school , she went to study at the Agent Trainning Agency where she learnt about guns , clues , agencies , etc .
She was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a Trade Center there .
Here is some further information about myself and a few enquirement .
It is really fasinating to challenge the waves .
As for accomodation , I would prefer log cabins , because I belive they are more comfortable than tents .
Will I be given any pocket - money or do I need to bring my own money to cover additional expences ?
Martial arts are realy exciting and are a great thing to film .
The main characther is the old man who has to fight against the sea to stay alive .
They 're fighting for the same reason with the same strenght , the man has to kill a brother , as he calls the fish .
On accound of the fact that staying in log cabins is much more interesting than staying in tents .
I can sing plenty of songs , which include English songs and the japenese songs , and I have a part - time job sining at a restaurant .
Futermore , I am going to enter a competition next year .
Shopping is not always enjoyable . Sometimes there is a long quare or a mechine is broken .
A lot of circumsenses will arise .
Everybody had gone to buy luch in the supermarket . In fact , nobody likes crowe and quare , expecially not in the summertime .
Abviously , I had to try another aisle .
It was the longest quare I have ever been in .
Even though I think most of the time it is very interesting , sometimes it gets people upsent .
Finally , the reasonable price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point , because all kinds of people can afford to buy them . I also think that you should have a snack bar or a little restaurant so that the people are not too hangry and morever you can make a lot of profit .
In conclusion , I do n't want to change anything in my house or at school , because I totaly agree with the few rules that I have .
I have choosen the two following activities .
I have choosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport . I love water but I have never tried this sport before .
Yours sincerly .
People are often irritable and agressive .
Because women love shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always give your opinion about clothes , music , parfums ...
yours sincerily
The things I did were : Prepearing and checking the equipment , I had to clean all the stadium , making sure that all the lights were in perfect working order , that the singers were confortable and relaxed , etc .
It would be a great plessure to spend two weeks at Camp California and I ca n't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm .
With regards accomodation I would prefer log cabins , as they are more comfortable and I like convenience .
They are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous .
So , as a conlusion , I might say that shopping is n't enjoyable at all and I 'd rather stay at home instead .
After the show I needed to drink something in the theatre restaurant as the advertisement concieved , but it was closed .
When Pat first came into a class or a groupe of teenagers there were no problems .
Insofar as I came here especially to see him play , I have been very disappointed , and this could be the understatement of the year , as he is my favorite actor .
Thirdly , the ad mentionned possible discounts .
Personnaly speaking , I did n't see them and did n't even hear of them : I asked about it , but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts .
As he closed his eyes , he started to travel along the dark paths of his councience .
The boy could not beleive what he was hearing .
At these words , Paul suddently awoke .
The show was called " Over the rainbow " and should be , to quote the advertisment , London 's newest and best musical show .
I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisment were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisment , but I had to pay the full price although I am a student .
The perfect evening you promised in your advertisment was the complete opposite and that is why I want to get some money back from you .
First of all , I was attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who performed effectly that evening .
These actors appeared fourty - five minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement .
And in conclusion I want you to give me my money back , ( I still have the advertisement if you want prooth of what I say ) .
As regards accomodation , I would choose to stay in tents .
I do n't know much about the weather down there , in California , so I am rather puzzeled about what to wear there .
Also , I would like to know how much money I will need and which expensies I will have to cover myself .
All these exhibiots are really important and exciting for us because , nowadays , fashion has a huge influence on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it .
We think that we could go there on the 14th of March , in the eveninng , instead of going shopping .
Nowadays , there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisments , reports about their last romance ... but not everyone does the same thing .
On the other hand , there are the ones that are also respectabled but , appart from their relations with journalists because of their work , they really need to be constantly sought by photographers .
The media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work , politicians for their campain and film stars to make their latest movie famous .
In conclusion , I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidently get into a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully .
In your letter you ask me to choose which type of accomodation I prefer .
Hopefull I will meet some other girls interested in the same sport .
Woods is thought to stand for all white peope and this book could have an influence on them .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because I am alergic to some insects that might get in a tent .
I spent two weeks preparing the stage , speakers , backdrop , michrophones , everything , with all the staff , and every night the artists came to rehearse their show . I could see how they really improved , and how nice they were with the staff .
I am writting this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called " Over the rainbow " with my wife and children . We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one .
But cars create pollution : for exemple the greenhouse effect .
Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences like medecine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live longer .
In my opinion it 's a lot better than the dictionnary because it 's faster and you really find what you need .
I am writting to you about an enjure that I had at your last musical at the Circle Theatre .
First of all , I was surpprising that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not perform .
I read in your advertisment in Friday 's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the performance started at 20.15 .
I was waitting 45 minutes for nothing !
I am a studiant and I did n't get a discount ticket .
I do n't understand the problem between your advertisment and the reality .
For exemple , if I do n't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework , I go on the Internet and ask for what I need .
From my point of view , the Internet is the most important invention of the 2000 centery . You can book tickets for the theatre , sport , etc .
I use the Internet all the time for my homework and in the futur , I hope , I will be able to use it for my own work .
Technology will not stop growing and helping people in the futur .
It was n't the first time I saw this show in your theatre , but it was the worsed one .
At first it was a great plessure for me to get a ticket becauses I 'm one of Danny Brook 's greatest fans .
It 's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had choosen it , because I 'm ( alowed ? ) .
When the musical started at 20:15 ( not at 19:30 as advertised ) I was realy shokked when I realised that a different actor was playing his role .
You have to know that I am very sik because of my blood presure and so I was laying down the whole weekend .
For me , as a scientist , it 's a big problem to show how the inovations of the last century went up with the environment and natur .
Nowadays a simple thing like a computer includes so many possible ways of destroying different environmental compartiments .
On the one hand there are the materials from which the PCs are made , on the other hand is the uge waste problem .
Now I try to show , in my daily work , how the airborn chlororganics , which are degased from plastics , will be seperated and damaged by green plants .
Sometimes it seems to me like a joke if I think about all the daungerous materials I need to do my job .
Therefore it makes sense to use the inovation which are causing environmental destruction .
When I was 15 , I was starting to look for new clothes , shoes , and everything I would find now unneccessary .
I would not dare to culculate how much I have spent on those things without thinking .
However , it was not bad . My mom always told me that I had n't earned enough money so I should n't have spent it in the wrong way .
I have never been to the USA , so I think that this trip will be an unforgetable experience .
I look foward to receiving your reply .
For pratical information , this show starts at 10.00 and closes at 19.00 .
It is not too far and the openning hours suit us .
We also suggest visiting the Science Museum on Wednesday morning and in the afternoon , if some of us are intersted , we could see the National Art Gallery .
They will become less dark and more confortable than today .
These improvments will be involved by the lack of petrol and non - renewable energy .
About the size of hous , I think that in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation .
But about the differences between the homes of the rich and poor , they will be the same in the futur .
I think that people will be as alone and julous as today .
As if this were not enough , once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for mainteneance .
After reading the whole organized programme , we all agreed about the sightseeing tour by bus around London , wich will give us the knowledge of this fantastic city we have all wanted to have since a long time ago .
We found the advertisment in a local newspaper and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity , because the show consists of these topics :
Instead of going to the science museum , we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show , wich is open on Tuesday , March 14 , from 10 am to 7 pm .
Yours sincirely
Not only because she 's famous and wrote lots of books , but she knows how to introduce caracthers and how to tell a good story us though decieving the readers .
In other words the story is set on a train wich tooks a trip along the orient .
On the train , all the passangers seem to be involved in a crime .
This is such a fasinating story and it 's the way Agatha Christie tells it .
The mistery is drawn out until the last page of the book .
I like Danny Brook very much , and his unaspected absence caused me great sadness .
It 's all right , but I also think that he 's exagerate .
I do n't think I have done such a bad thing as to destroy our friendness .
I like his company , and we are happy when we are togheter .
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO EXPRIME MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " , PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO ; FIRST OF ALL , I READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW , BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS A DIFFERENT ONE , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING .
I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOPE ALONG VERY DIFFERENT LINES : THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST , AS WE CAN NOTICE NOW , OR A MORE FANTASCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPEMENT .
SURELY , ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV . AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE , I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCALIZED ON COMFORTABILITY MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE .
BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPEMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD , IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE , THAT IS A TOO VARIED A CATHEGORY .
One of my hobbies is photography , so I think I am rather good at it , but I will take painting to learn , because I am not very talentive at it .
After carrying stuff like lights , microphones , wires and some other equipment for about three hours , I was eshausted .
It 's a great opportunity for me to participate in your Camp California because normaly I work a lot and I ca n't spend money on travel . Moreover , I have to support a big family because I 'm married and I have three children .
I have to choose painting and photography therefore . I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think of my helth .
I 'm very enthousiastic and I wait for your answer as soon is possible .
FIRST OF ALL , IN YOUR ADVERTISMENT YOU SAID THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE , BUT I COULDN'T FIND THEM AVAILABLE ANYWHERE .
THE PLAY STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT : FOURTY - FIVE MINUTES LATE .
MY ADRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE . I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE .
I like to sleep in a tent under the open sky since I have done military service , therfore I would prefer a tent as my accomodation .
It is important for my health that I swim an hour a week because I am overwight .
When I have enough money the price is n't important , then I can buy a lot of things whitout considering my money .
Finally , I am going to write about the theater , the Circle Theatre .
I 'm looking forward to recieving a letter from you .
The rooms will be designed in a futuristic fashion , where there will be less furniture and everything will be compact . Even TV - sets will be on the ciling .
Technology also means all electrical machines , which do n't stop being developped .
Machines have replaced the work of humains .
Our whole life is being simplified by machines for not waste the time to work on their developpment .
Here I will answear all the questions that you asked me , and I will ask you about other things that you did n't mention .
I 'd like to organize my trip for July because that is when I have vacations , also because it is summertime in the U.S.A . About acomodation at Camp I 'd prefer a tent , because it 's a new expirence for me and I 'd like to sleep in a tent to have a great time while having a new adventure .
Thank you very much for your colaboration .
Most of the time when we go to the shopping Center we have a lot of fun . We go to stores to look at clothing , we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries , but is not enjoyable all the time .
In that instance we do n't enjoy shopping because we ca n't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping center .
I was absolutely threaled to resive the news about my winning a competition .
I do n't like cold nights and moscitos .
Yours faithfyly
Usualy people do n't have time for shopping .
There are huge queus to the tills , noise , hussle , poor custumer service .
You 've got more stress , you feel fed up and finaly when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you thought .
There are so many varaity of products , different prices , different qualities .
Nowadays tecnical progress gets close to us , to normal custumers .
Without any hussle , sitting in your chear in front of your computer , in a second you can get to any shop that has an internet site - most of the big companies have one - get all the information about the product , get a cheaper price and buy it .
I know that staying in a log cabin is more convinient but I just want to have a wilder experience .
And I want to know how much money I have to bring for personnal expences .
Besides , I really would like to know approxiametely how much money I should take with me .
Concerning the activities , I have choosen two of them .
It was boring that nothing happend for such a long time on the stage .
And finally , I would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thougt I would go to ' Theatre restaurant ' .
This is not a tabu subject with me and my friends .
I had dout when somebody said that the fashion of the future would be different .
Are they inclued in the prize ?
I 'd prefere it if you gave me this information as soon as you can .
However , those days were unforgatable for me .
I will be very happy to travel in July because in that month I am going to have my holidays , so I will not have to ask permition from my boss .
I would prefer to stay in a tent , couse in that way I can feel closer to nature , and I can remember when I was a girl scout .
At the camp I would like to choose two activities , Painting and Singing . I love painting . At university I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint couse I work in a bank and I have a baby .
The reason for my choice of singing is that I feel embarrest about my voice , so maybe I could improve it .
Thank you for givin me this oportunity .
You are never going to believe what I did last month . I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus , when sudently a man stopped us saying that he was looking for people to help at a concert and they were going to pay us five pounds an hour .
We sed yes inmidiatly . I nearly shouted with happiness when they told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert . He is my favorite singer .
The concert was on a Sunday and we had to work at the back of the stadge , doing all sorts of things like colecting rubish and helping other people who were working there .
Other bad points can be mentioned , like polution for example .
I am writting to you to complain about the musical show , where everything was completely different from the advertisement .
Modern life has been full of science and tecnologies .
I am very pleased that I was born in a time when there is such good tecnologies but my parents did n't have the same luck .
My life is much easier with all this stuff mentioned above - tecnology and science .
The bad side is we can use tecnology for war - missiles , weapons , etc ....
Indeed tecnology has changed our lives , we have become more scepitical and cold .
Sometimes I think tecnology is not a good thing ....
People whom I work with are going on holiday in Juni and August .
Also , the accomodation I would prefer at Camp California is the log cabin , because first when I was a little child we stayed in a small house every holiday and I like that .
However , drawing some beautiful sceanary and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me .
I 'm not keen on liars , Mr Smith , and I think that you 've lied to naive tourists like us : some brilliant actors were supposed to play the parts and we only had different , pityful ones .
Otherweise I 'll have to put some other ads out in London saying that your show is just a fraud !
Nowadays , the Internet and the mobile phone , with the developpment of satellite communication , seem to take the lead .
As far as I am concerned , the first way modern technology influences me is through my work : the Internet has become such an incredible tool , I can research into everything I want , find information for lectures , for example , or exercices .
Maybe it will change me into a kind of self - centered person , a loner .
But we should not forget that they are only tools and should emphazise human relationships .
Finaly , I 'd like to play tennis and to try climbing .
This book remains one of the best in American litterature .
Based on a very simple story , the story of an old man fishing , it is a deep reflexion on age .
A veteran fisherman takes his boat and goes fishing to convine himself and other men that he is still able to do it .
The 24-hour fight is described in such a peacful , faithful way that it callas a though about life and death .
I recommand this book as a way to discover both Hemingway and American litterature .
Before answering your letter ( which I have just recieved ) about the prize for the competition I recently won , I 'd like to say thank you very much for giving me the chance of going to the USA .
About the accomodation , I think I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent , since it is more comfortable .
In addition to this , I would like to know the ammount of money I should bring , as well as the kind of clothes that I could need and the sort of people that I will find there .
None of the groups are known at the moment , but I belive they are well on their way to becoming famous bands .
This was the best part because when everyone was gone , Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginers ! ! !
I could n't belive my eyes ...
Jane took a photograph of us toghether .
Lastly , I do not think I would call this my perfect evening , so I would like to ask for a refund , and I hope as the Manager of London 's newest theatre , you will handle the situation favourbly .
Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality , he 'll never be able to keep any secreats from anyone , even himself .
Although , we are great friends , sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes , and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight . It all started when once I accidently took the wrong bag back to my house , and there were lady 's knickers inside . I was so nervous and embarassing , so I told Pat and off he went : he told every single student in the school that I 'd stolen a girl 's knickers , and everyone started to call me a pervert .
When I was a yong child , I used to be interested in reading science fiction .
First I can travel only in July because I will finish school at the end of June and I will sit my exam in Septemeber ; so I have to revise for it a lot during the month of August .
I particulary liked seeing all those people , and I met a lot of new friends there .
I would like to travel only in July because I would be on school holydays then and the weather is hot and the sea 's temperature is less cold than in winter .
It is very nice to stay in tents wich are strong and confortable .
And you need a strategie to win the match .
But you ca n't play if there is too much wind , because the ball becomes incontrolable !
It looks fragil and it could break easily .
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautifull country .
It will be very interesting for me because normaly I do not have a lot of time to do activities .
I would prefer swimming because I really like it and I am trying to swim anywhen I have got some time , and painting because I have finished a painting course and I have some practice with this .
That is very nice that all costs are paited for but I would like to ask you how much money I should take with me because I do not know anything about prizes in the U.S.A. and please tell me if I need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me , so if I will need to take everything I will just change this activite .
It was a realy wonderfull new experience for me .
The people were wonderfull , they were helping each other with everything and it was a lot easier to do .
I am writing to you , because I would like to disagree with your advertisment for the show ' over the Rainbow ' .
As it is said in the advertisment the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes , because according to the programme it started at 20.15 , but that is not the end of the story ; in your advertisment it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets . That was not true !
I was still not very disappointed , because I hoped that I would have a good meal with a glass of wine in the restaurant , which I could have according to your advertisment , but what I did not realise , it was closed , because the chef was in hospital .
Such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world , even if I am not at home ; I use a stereo if I want to listen to my favourite music ; I use tapes , CDs , hairdryers , ect .
Many years ago people did n't have an oppotunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot .
This is just a note to confirme for you that I have recive your letter .
To answer your questions , I would like to tell you that I can only travel in July , because I will be studying for the Cambrigge exam till 1 July .
Would it be possible to have accomodation at Camp California in a tent , because I haven't had a chance to sleep in one .
And would it be possible to do swimm and surfing .
I have been driming about this activitie since I was 10 years old .
I would like to know how many peopl will stay with me in the tent , and do I have to take with me any special clothes for surfing .
I look forward to beeing at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I think going shopping in a big spaise like Harrodss is not a plesure .
I like to be in small boutiques , and I would rather go shopping along and during the weekand .
And going shopping after the weekand is not for me .
I would like to travel in July because I am a studant so I only have holidays in this part of the year .
About the acomodations , I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to staying in them when I travel .
Sometimes , shopping can be really boring , especially on important dates when the shops are absolutaly crowded and you ca n't see anything you wanted with carefull .
I received your letter this morning . Thank you very much for your kind letter and for chosing me .
I have knowladge of navigation , engine , ropes and knots , and sails as well .
It was a nightmare , there were pickpokets in the shop .
But you must always be on your guard against pickpokets .
I am only able to take my holidy in July . The rest of the year I work .
I 'm crayz about tennis and swimming .
Can you imagene Friday night ?
You have worked hard all day . On the way home you want to pick up some milk from the shop and you have to waite ten minutes on average .
There are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficut .
After shopping you have to carry a havy bag a long way home
But the situation was n't simple , so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary , the teacher 's cousine .
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accomodation because I have had all my holidays with my parents in luxury hotels .
Pat entered the fight , and it became more loud and agressive .
I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely dissapointed by the show .
It was about 21:00 , I thought it was a bit later but it was n't my falt anyway .
100 years ago , people dressed diffrently .
The enviroment will be very polluted and finally we 'll get desease . We will need helmets to cover our heads and we will also need air - supplyer .
Maybe , science will be developed and make our enviroment clean , and we will not wear anything at all ! ! ! ( except underwear ) .
I hope that the enviroment will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be .
The advertisement promised there would be my favorite star , Danny Brook , but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook . In addition , the performance started 45 minutes late , so we could n't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already .
So I am sure you will understand why I am so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incindent .
Two days before , her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to devorce . Maria was so upset that she could n't keep it to herself .
They could not believ their eyes .
Maria had bought his favorite food and she threw it into the bin .
She went to skool , but she could not follow the lessons as easily as she used to .
Moreover , the theatre restaurant was closed for mentenance .
In addittion , I can go to Britain by plane to see her .
When I recived your letter , I could not belive it .
Unfortunatelly , I will only be able to go in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for that month .
I am in doupt as to what kind of clothes I have to bring with me .
I had the best expreience in my life .
Can you guess whe they chossed for the job , " me " , yes , me , I could n't belived it .
My job basequily was to , before and after the actuation , make everything ready .
To be honnest the most exciting part of all this was getting to know the group .
Yours Sincierly ,
First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the consert would take place .
I am writing to you to " help " you with your festival next year . Last year was n't very good so maybe we can make it more atracite this year .
First , I think we shoul rent bigger halls so that we can make a better sound and give more space for the audience !
We can inaute stars and artists from around the world who will play and prisentspresent all kinds of music like jazz , rock , classical ect .
Afterwards we could let people talk with the artists so they could get to know theyr personally .
If you want to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it pleace contact me on my cellphone .
Yours Sincirley
First of all , it dipends what kind of school it is :
Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have fewer pracite lessons , and sometimes it 's hard to get books or other things needed for studying .
School is supose to be our second home but it 's not . We work hard and at the end of our education we still have nothing .
I would make schools less unstressfull , with added fun 'cause that way it 's easier to learn and I would give students more chances to share their fantazy at school .
Maybe the Polish system is not bad , but it 's conftyble too .
I know that this letter will not change anything but you can see how compliated a Polish student 's life is .
I 'm not sure about the weather in California in the daytime and in the nightime .
Thank you very much for your offerring .
From my point of view , your organisation has to be careful to orginize an activity .
It was unpleasent for me to see different actors on the stage .
In the advertisement that I received , it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept wainting for it to start for half an hour .
I am writing to you about my complaints about the musical show at your theater that I watched a week ago , during my stay in London .
Another problem was the male actor who starred : the well - known and talented actor mentioned in the advertisement was replaced by another one , who was really very disappointing and after the performance , I visited the theater restaurant , which was supposed to be open and available for meals after the show , but it was closed .
I appriciated this big news .
I am very keen on photography so I definetely will choose this as one of my activities at the camp .
I have got some experience already and I 'm used to any weather conditions , furthermore I simply love water sports and their chalenges .
My tasks were very especifics .
Its name is " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " , and I really was impressioned with the coherence of the stories .
It 's estimulating to read them .
I 'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately , and find out there are many challenges in your new carreer .
We are wating for your decision and we will accept it whatever it may be .
The clearest example is to compare a house from the beginings of the 20th century with our houses . Both are very similar but now we have new technologies .
I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved your letters and I am going on the trip .
Every night I would like to go out of the small tent into the nice enviroment outside the tent .
I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound prize .
At first I was surprised but a few secound later , when I relised that I was n't allowed to go , I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go .
I had to keep things in place and cheakd that the microphones were working properly .
I was really embarassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that was the very best experience I have ever had .
Tell me yoors . I want to know what experiences you had when you were in England .
I would be greatful if you could include this show in your programme .
This is a great oppotunity for me to explore and experience London myself , especially The London fashion and leisure shows .
Most of the shows are about fashinable things for students my age .
I think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of show , for instance latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , how to put on make - up and how to have propiate hairstyles .
In my opionion , I think you should have this event in the afternoon instead of going shopping and move the shopping slot to the afternoon on Wednesday .
I trust you to pay immidiate attention to my suggestions .
I closed my eyes , tooke a deep breath and jumed out of the tower .
There were hundrend of Thai students waiting to take this test .
I was very afraid of the hieght and was very nervous .
I was given the list of activities while I was taking part in the adventure school schems at the soldier camps in the north of Thailand .
The last task I had to do was jume out of the high tower .
I eventaully managed to complete all the tasks that I had been given and I was very proud of this .
Suprisingly the show started at 20:15 .
Of course I accepted immidiately .
After school Larry and I went to the cinema , but at the enterance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us .
When we arrived at the shopping center , I saw a lot of people .
The task was not easy , at 18 you do n't know too much about cryptographic algoritms and databases but anyway we decided to do it . There was nothing to lose .
Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure systems and new encryptation algorithms .
You should n't go shopping when the shopps are so busy because it 's so annoying .
You do n't have to be a genius to notice that technology has evoluated so considerably during the last few decades that our everyday life has changed .
I 'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent . And with the tent I can go to enougher place in the camp .
And I like painting because I like to paint nature , sea , moutains .
I whant to know some information about it .
I 'm realy lookind forward to your answers . And I hope to see you soon .
Yours sencerely Gubin .
I absolutly agree with this .
Because I have my own expirience of shopping .
For exsample , resently I was shopping at the market , which is located in the center of our town .
When I was there I saw a very beatiful T - shirt .
I was abset about it .
Our goverment is very burocrative .
Our ministers are really criminal . They often breake the law , stealing money .
Because of it our state ca n't pay workers in schools , hospetols , on building sites . In our country there is a high nomber of unemploeers .
Often people ca n't buy a piece of bread . And they ask for money from enougher people .
I wich that my accommodation at Camp California it must be in a tent .
Anyway I enjoed it so much .
I haven't been to a concert before so the atmosphier was really good .
Do you remember the computer course that we took together . It was very useful to clasifay each person at the concert .
I congradulate you because that 's perfect .
The advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook . Unfortunately there was someone else - an actor who I do not like and if I had known that he was going to be there I woud not have gone to see him .
In fact , modern technology was already very popular and comonly used when I was born , so I can not say that it changed my life suddenly .
All these products of science are with me from the very beging of my day .
On the other hand , I am aware of all the disadvantages of modern technology ; pollution and the dangarous it brings .
But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my centuary - the age of modern science .
I am writing to answer your invitation which I have receved as a first prize winner .
There are also many kinds of take - away restaurants , where I can taste my favorite foods .
But there is alwalys a lot of traffic at all times , and the air is so polluted that I ca n't even breathe .
I always feel very tired after the shopping because of unfrendly people who are too busy .
What is more , admittion for students is free .
However , we have got a suggestion : we saw an advertissement for " the London Fashion and Leisure Show " which is going to be on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 to 19:00 .
I was pleased to recieve your letter ricently .
Now I 'm going to give you some information you asted about .
I 'm sory to say this , but the only time I will be able to take this trip is in July , according to our team 's shudule .
The next thing - I would prefer to spend all the nights in a tent , so I can move it to the place that will suit me best . I like to wake up with a view of mountains , wich reminds me of my 5 years ' experience of climbing .
So , is it posible ? I would like to continue doing my favorite hobbies in the Camp .
Otherwise , you will either not find what you are looking for , or you will , and spend the rest of the day in a bad mood , because of the bad maners of sales people , who do not give you advice every time you ask for it .
To summarise everything , I would recomend spending less time indoors , shopping during the weakdays .
You wrote ' discouts available ' but they did n't offer any discount .
But it was unpleasent because of these things .
Owing to all of them , I can live very comfortbly .
In your letter you wrote that I will have the chance to do two activities ; first of all I would like to play tennis because I have been plaing for seven years . Secondly I would like to attend a surfing course but I have just some elementary knowledge .
It will be interesting to show how the lessons are organized , saing that we are never doing just one activitie during the class .
After that we have to make sure that we explain about the relationship betwen teachers and students , showing the times that we have been out together .
Finaly we should give some information also about our tourism , business and computer courses .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in a tent because I enjyoi being outside close to nature .
Sometimes the bad charachters in a story are more interesting than the good ones .
Its title was : " The Mistery of Hunter 's Lodge " .
The charachter whom I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering , the mistress .
It was very exciting because she could play two people at the same time : herself and the houskeeper .
First of all I would like to say that it started later than it should have . I had to wait for about fourty - five minutes .
Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show , which was very disappoiting for me because I like this actor very much , and I think that I was not the only one who was upset .
Yours sincerlly ,
They are very usefull things which sometimes are nessecary to survive .
I watch about four hourers of TV a day . I even eat my meals in front of the TV . We can see PEOPLE 'S LIFE in other countries , which is very interesting for me and my friends .
Also the Iternet has an influence on my daily life , beause I can find there many interesting things , or I can meet with people from all over the world , which is exciting for me .
I think that life without modern technology would be simple and borring . That 's why I am using it in my daily life . I am happy that there is such a thing as modern technology .
Finaly the day to pay my credit card arrived and where was my money ?
All the students are happy that we will have othe oppurtinatey to visit London for three days .
In the morning , we will have the chance to see some of the sightseeings of London by bus , for example , the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery .
The reason I write to you is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , for a fiew days .
The show is free for students and we can see the show instat of having free time on Wednesday in the afternoon .
Ourdays , with the help of the media , famous people , like politicians or filmstars , play an important role in our community .
Who got married , who got divorsed or who has experienced a remarkeable change in his complexion , these are questions that most journalists are interested in .
There were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisment .
In the advertisment it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play the main roles .
The advertisment said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 .
The advertisment said that they would be available but they were not .
It was written in the advertisment that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show , but unfortunatelly it was closed .
We build big cities , there is hot and cold water , electricity , gas in particulary every home .
Many different uncureable diseases have appeared .
I 'm writeng with reference to your letter . I was really thrilled , when I found out that I won first prize in your competition . I always dreamed about going to California and now my dreams are coming true .
I 've always wanted to learn to sing professionaly , but I 've never had an opportunity .
When she tried to answear me , one small child took her picture with a flash .
Trully , my work here was n't very important , but I relly enjoyed it .
I 'm writting this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in London .
So I 'm writting this letter , asking if you can change the programme .
There is a great opportunity to go there because students need not pay anyting .
Our first chalenge was stealing Dick 's girlfriend 's panties , but we failed .
Nick and Dick could prove their bravure stealing their mother 's panties .
" It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it " , to prove my bravure to everyone .
I USUALLY SWIM THREE TIMES A WEEK IN ORDER TO MANTEIN A BACK TREATMENT WHICH MY DOCTOR HAS RECOMMENDED ME TO FOLLOW .
SO , IF POSSIBLE , I WAS INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING MY ROUTIN THERE .
LASTLY , I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME IF I HAVE TO BRING SOME MONEY WITH ME TO BUY FOOD OR DRINKS AND HOW THE CLIMATE OF THE CAMPING AREA IS SO I CAN PACK MY LUGGAGE , BRINGING ONLY THE APROPPIATES CLOTHES .
THIS BOOK CONTAINED NINE STORIES WHICH WERE WRITTEN BY WELL - KNOWN WRITTERS LIKE RAY BRADBURY .
BUT THE MAIN PURPOUSE OF THE BOOK IS TO ALLOW YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR IMAGINATION AND TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF HOW LIFE IS GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE , WHEN , PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL BE RULED BY MACHINES .
SO , IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A " REALLY SPLENDID SCIENT FICTION BOOK " I WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO READ " A WINDOW .. " AND I'M SURE THAT WHEN YOU FINISH READING IT YOU WILL WANT TO READ IT AGAIN , AND AGAIN ... !
I would like to ask whather you have competitions or different activities .
Do you reccomend me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well ?
I worked untill midnight every day .
It was very enjoyable . I made lots of friends . We were together all day , painting the walls , cleaning and putting up some baloons and other stuff everywhere .
Famous people must enderstand that the journalists are doing their job .
Second , regarding accomodation , I 'd like to stay in a log cabin .
I also want to know if I should take any money , or if all the expences are paid by you .
That makes those people frustrated and they do n't enjoy theirselves .
Regarding accomodation in tents or log cabins , I would enjoy much more being in a tent as I believe that is the right type of accomodation for going camping .
Men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as their favourite passtime .
Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes . However , do we really like the process of chosing them ?
I 'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organiced last 21 and 22 of November .
The festival was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
In my opinion the hall for the rock concets was too small . You have to consider booking a bigger one for next year because these kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people .
At school it is completely different because the teachers do n't foregive you anything .
I would n't like to change anything because we all need some dicipline to do the right things .
At first my favourite actor Danny Brook did n't perform , without any explictions being given , and the show should have started at 19:30 instead of 20:15 ! !
I was sure that discouts were available because I had read that they were , but at the ticket office they did n't offer them .
All this story was a secret but Pat realived it to his mother .
I am writing to you because I am really dissapointed about " Over the Rainbow " which I saw the other day during my stay in London which your company organized .
I explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and I want you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happenned there .
Yours fainthfully
If we create guns to protect our homes , others will use them to burgle our homes , and take advantage of the indefense people .
Because I have had experiance of staying in a tent and I like it very much .
In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever plaed .
I have just finished a profesional photography course and I would like to continiew my education in this activity .
I was shoked because I had alredy spoken with them and I had got two autographs .
Another part of my experiance at the pop concert when we meet each other .
First of all , the actors mentionned in the advertisement were not those who performed in the show .
Plus , it is mentionned in your advertisement that discounts are available . In fact , no discount was given to me , though I am a student and as a student I was entitled to get a discount but I paid £ 20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show .
As a student , the low priced ticket certainly athacted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists .
Finally , I would like to make one big suggestion : you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way do n't have to spend money on accomodation .
Furthermore , departement stores are always looking for students who would like to work .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is an amaizing show because there are parades with the latest fashions . We could see some famous top models . Also there will be a variety of clothes either sports wear as elegant desings .
I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it , when a shower of stones covered the entrace of the hole .
I walked alone a long distence until I found a telephone . I called the police and they ask for a rescue .
When we finished at our primary school we went to the same secundary school too , but we were in different classes .
And when we finished at the secundary school , I decided go to a foreign University .
In my opinion , the clothes will be more colourful , fun and confortable .
People will prefer to wear confortable clothes , even to go to the office .
Actually , I think that the clothes will be really simplier in 100 years and I hope to be alive until then .
However , when I saw it , I was really disapointed and I must ask you for some money back .
First of all , Danny Brook was not there . I was very upset because he is my favorite singer and that was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this show .
On the developpement , they also said that there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty - five years old but that was totally wrong because I paid the full price , which was £ 20 .
I am writting in order to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow " .
Regarding the times of the performance , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 . Nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenary .
I was waiting for 45 minuties .
You can send a letter to your friend by e - mail instead of writting it on a piece of paper and sending it by post .
After that " show " we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurand but what a surprise !
Let 's take the mobil phone .
Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is " mobil " .
I 'm writting this letter to complain about your fake advertisement .
First of all , in your show advertisement it sais that Danny Brooks stars in the play .
In the evenings before I go to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV via sattelite .
When I go to bed , because there are many mosquitoss , I turn on a special machine with a battery - like thing in it which kills them .
I belive that modern technology has positively affected our lives .
In order to fullfill their readers ' requirements they constantly follow them .
On the other hand , famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures , because althoug they are famous they also have their private life .
Your programme is very good , especially as we can go to visit the Science Museum , which I heard is very good , but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the lastest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles and it is free for students too .
I climed up the tree .
It was badly hurt . My friend rushed to me , then ran back to my house and called Mom .
Mom came in , looking very angry . I prayed for a short conversation .
I want to complain about your advertisment for the production ' Over the Rainbow ' ; I had a very disappointing evening .
Yesterday when I arrived at college , I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strangely at me and laufhing .
People started to whrite things on the board and to point at me .
It is a great failing of responsability for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one .
Finally , the restarant where I would have liked to have dinner with friends after the show was closed , contrary to what was announced in the advertisement .
I 'm writting to answer your questions but , first of all , to thank you for the prize .
I would like to travel in July because it is the school holliday here in Portugal and I will have the entire month to travel , so I have no preference for which weeks .
I 'm looking forward to receving your letter .
I have to say that I am realy disappointed with your advertisement because you mentioned some points that are not true .
Secondly , another ploblem was the starting time . According to your advertisement , the play starts at 19.30 but instead it started at 20:15 , this is almost an hour 's delay .
The simpliest example of modern high technology is the introduction of the computer - better known as the PC .
Reserches has shown that almost every single household owns a PC . Some people use them for their job because they need it , but others , like children , use it just for fun .
Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the TV , the microwave , the video , the satelite dish , the CD player and hundreds of others .
All thease play an important role in our daily life without us ever understanding them .
Those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable , but they take us away from our friends , our families and moreover they lead us to madness and cut off any relantionship with everything that suround us and keeps us alive .
I think that is going to be more confortable for me due to the fact that I am very sensitive to changes of temperature and I ca n't take the risk of catching a cold because , as you know , I 'm going to start to work .
How are you ? I 'm fine and I am writting to you because I know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert ; I have to tell you that I did help there and it was very hard work . You ca n't imagin all the work that goes into preparing a concert .
I am writting to you to complain about the last Saturday evening performance at your theatre .
Finaly , I want to know what the weather is like in California in July .
The teacher uses video and pictures to teach students about festivals , sports , museums , ect .
Basketball is the most popular activity , whick takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week .
I have recieved your letter and I am so glad I have won the first prize .
I have been practcing tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16 's U.S open tournament last summer .
I 'm writting to complain about your theatre and its show last night .
Firstly I would like to say that I was very dissappointed with the show and that I did n't have the perfect evening out , as advertised .
The main character of the musical show , who I 'd like to say was n't the " BEST " , was awfull .
And then , when I arrived at the theatre , I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I did n't .
On top of all this , the theatre restaurant was closed because the shef and the waiters were on holiday .
I was very dissappointed , what else can I say .
It was supposed to be my perfect everning out .
In conclusion , I 'd like to recoment that you should first know what you have to offer and then advertise it .
Yours sensirly
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I should n't have told her that my dad had physcological problems .
All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accitend .
When one day Pat came over to my house , we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fite the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up .
Pat started shouting and screaming , saying what was realy going on .
Also with weekend shopping , you ca n't find somewhere to sit down comfortaly to have a cup of tea .
According to your advertisement , it stars DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE , but surprisinggly , was proformed by a different actor of whom I did n't even know the name .
Nowadays , we use a lot of modern technology both at home and in the office but it has its aventage and disaventage .
The first and most important thing is that modern technology has made our life easier , for instance the rice cooker is a great invention , all you have to do is put rice in it and switch it on , it makes cooking more effeciently .
Furthmore , we use the computer and telephone a lot .
Mankind became more and more clever and built wonerful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands .
Although there are new machines etc , medicine makes many discoverts thanks to research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer .
I have won the first prize ! I am extremly happy about this .
I can only take a holiday in July because I am going to start a new education at the beginn of August .
Staying in a tent will remind me of an unforgottable time .
Given the circumstances , I would like to learn more about Photograhy and painting .
Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I take travellers ' queckes ?
I applied for a job at the ticket office because I hoped to see a lot of diffrent people .
I had to prepare the ingredians for every meal .
That meant I had to read the recipies very carefully .
I am writing to you to complate about the show " Over the Rainbow " at your theatre " The Circle Theatre " .
I am deeply disapointed with the service and the unrealiable information at your theartre .
I am very disapointed by this .
You also mention that your show would start at 19.30 but to my knowleage it started at 20:15 and that meant fourty - five minutes of waiting .
It also mentioned other services would be availalde to the adicne .
For Example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show , when it was meant to be open after the show acording to the advertisement but it was closed dure to the delay with the preformane .
And I would like a refun . You have wasted my evening and money .
Synethetic have been created by scientis .
Clothes are now mass - produced and desing by desingers .
Desingres are unique in a way but their desings are sometimes more a pirce of art and not for everyday perposoe .
It is hard to imageine what people will wear in 100 years ' time , because since the 1900s clothes have reduce into smaller item and more preticle .
Maybe it would contine reducing in 100 years to come .
Scinetis might discover a new way to make clothes more fixalde .
It would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could chosse what you want to wear by pressing bottons .
This would be very easy to mantage but it would mean no more shopping for girls .
It would be scarly to live in the new 100 years , but it would be interesting to see what will happen .
The next thing is that I would prefer a log cabine .
I was responsible for the advertisments and I also had to invite the " important people " from our governement .
It was realy a new job for me , but I think I did well .
There were two other problems : there were no discounts , contrary to the information in the advertisement , and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repairement work .
However , she definetely deserved to have a private life as a citizen .
Thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition . I also want to congratulate you on your exellent competition , thanks to which I have the opportunity to go to California , a place that I always wanted to go to .
About the trip , I think it would be preferable to do it in July , which is a holiday periode and so I wo n't have any special obligations .
Spending a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worst thing to do , specialy during a holiday !
Any little tournaments of this kind would be greateful .
Moreover instead of bying a ticket I went there for free , as a helper .
The pop concert was exellent and I had a lot of fun .
I AM WRITTING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOUR THEATRE PUT ON .
I WENT TO YOUR THEATRE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A GREAT TIME . UNFORTUNETELY , THINGS WENT VERY WRONG .
SECONDLY , THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO START AT HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE AFTERNOON , BUT IT STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGH ,
THAT IS FOURTY - FIVE MINUTES LATER ! IT IS ALSO ADVERTISED THAT THERE WERE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE . HOWEVER , THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE .
LASTLY , AFTER THAT AWFULL EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT , OF COURSE , I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .
UNFORTUNETELY , PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS AND I DISCOVERED THAT TOO LATE .
THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWIN FRIDAY , WICH WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS .
Dear Mr. maneger of The Circle Theatre :
Could you , if we may ask , reorganise our visit to the museum and also to the shopping center .
Perhaps we could spend our free time at the museum before going to the shopping center .
Whateaver you do , journalists should not follow you every second .
The problem is that most of the advertistment was misleading .
But the main reason for my complaint , is that in the advertistment it was said it would be my perfect evening out , and it was not .
And the best thing is that it entertaints me alone or with people .
I have just receised your letter and I thanck you for your invitation and congratulations .
As regards accomodation , I prefer a longer , Canadian tent in a quiet place because I am fond of nature and I would like to feel free in an informal setting .
I like competitive and changelling sports . I enjoy comparing my skill with other players and , if possible , I would rather not do indoor sports activities , but open air ones .
I have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choise and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy .
The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good at explaing problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject .
Also the sports activities should be filmed ; they express an aggregative and social way of living school life and can be useful to show the moviments of the bodies during the school athletics events .
The dancing lessons should also be filmed , especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their moviments .
We were interested in seeing the actors that appeard on the tickets and I was very disappointed when , in the show , we saw other actors .
I am looking fordward to hearing from you .
I 'm looking fordward to hearing from you .
I have just recived your letter and I 'm very happy because of it , especially becouse the competition was so hard .
Being at Camp California was one of the dreams of my life and now I can relaized it .
However , about accommodation , I 'd prefer a log cabin , becouse it is more confortable than a tent .
Firstly , I was very embaracing during the concert , but all the staff were very kind to me and Tom too .
THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS THE HISTORY OF WORLD CONQUEST . THAT SAID , TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED CONTINOUSLY SINCE THE BEGGINING OF MAN 'S EVOLUTION . FURTHERMORE , DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES , THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOSION . WHILE THE XIX CENTURY GAVE US THE STEAM ENGINE , FACTORIES AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB , THIS CENTURY HAS GIVEN US NUCLEAR ENERGY ( AND SADLY ATOMIC WEAPONS ) , THE COMPUTER , THE INTERNET AND TELEVISION .
I 'd like to tell you that the best month for me to travel to the U.S.A . is July because I will be on hollidays in that month .
I do n't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California , but if I can tell you wich one I prefer I 'll choose to stay in a tent .
The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out . Marevellous !
Two days before I read an advertisment for this show , which said that Danny Brook was starring .
Apart from that , the show started at 20:15 , not at 19:30 , as it said in the advertisment and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished .
When I went to my bedroom I reliased that Pat had told my mother about the party , because no one else knew that my mother did not know that .
I am writting in order to complain about the musical show , the name of which is Over the Rainbow , which I saw in your theatre recently .
It was a pitty but it did not annoye me because I thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 for .
After the show I decided to go to have a coffee and to smoke a cigarrete to try to calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the barman 's day off .
I am very indignatged because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you to return my money and take note of all these problems .
Maybe it would be a nice idea to analize these changes and to put limits on technology , because I think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it .
Firstly , the show did not start on time but fourty - five minutes late .
This actor was not nearly as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied so much money if I had known this before .
The worst thing of all was that at the beggining of the show I realized that the actors were totally different from the ones advertised .
They were worse than the previst actors .
They believe that people in the future will wear confortable clothes because they will be outgoing , amusing , etc .
And people will wear cibernetic clothes but at the same time comfortable clothes .
I recived your letter recently , and I am really happy to learn that I have won the first prize .
About the acommodation during those two weeks , I would rather stay in a log cabin , as it is really difficult for me to stay in a little close room .
I had an induction climbing course two years ago , and I still climb regulary . I can do a V+ level climb .
Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular . The shopping centers are always busy , with people going up and down carrying bags and looking in shop windows ; it seems everbody is happy .
To sum up , shopping is not always enjoyable , but do n't worry , the shooping center is still there waiting for you !
I can only travel in July because this is the mounth when I have holidays .
I 've already talked to my manager , and she said that that 's the only mounth I can have my holidays .
I 've been playing tannis since I was seven , and I 've been studying how to play tannis for a very long time , nine years .
You know how good I am at music Anyway I was helping at this pop concert to get the corect sounds . At the bigging I was conecting all these wires into spekers , music system , guitars etc ... The bit that I particularly liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar - you know how much I love playing guitar - and all these video cameras were just filming us .
I asked one of the cameramen when they 're going to show this show on tv , and he told me they 're going to show it on the 10 of June , so turn on your tv on this date , chanel three , and you will see me there playing this guitar . AH , it was lovely .
What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebreties .
I particularly liked listening to their musicians when they played the piano , clarinet , drums , violen etc .
Pat promised not to speak to anyone about the car , but one evening Philip overhead her speaking about this with her boyfriend : " It will be delievered on Thursday !
Furthermore , the show started at 20:15 while the advertisment said that it was going to begin at 19:30 .
I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all the promises that were made in the advertisment .
Of course , what was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening , and I would be very greatful if you could refund me the price of my ticket .
Sciencist will invent new materials that will keep the body 's temperature in a suitable range .
For that reason clothes will be simplier and more practical .
Of course , the resources used and the manufacturing will be completely harmless for the enviroment because people will be more aware of the neccesity of taking care of the world we live in .
And it 's all the more tyring since you often wait for two weeks before getting it .
I think that this tendence will not change but what will change is life .
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisment , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and make some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take into consideration .
In your advertisment you mentionned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world , unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented .
The night he came into this world was one of grater for the habitants of the country and also of the town where he was born , it was an ordinary night .
To begin with , according to your advertisement , discount tickets are availabe .
The tickets were rather expensive , and the discounts mentionned in the advertisement were n't at all available at the theatre .
Pat was my friend , I trusted her and we got on very well untill she repeated to everyone the secret I had told her .
Regarding accomodation I 'd prefer to sleep in a tent becaose I like beeing outside and hearing the noises of the sea .
a maths lesson , an English lesson , a swimingpool lesson , the break and the staff room .
- We could show the activities of the students during the break . For exemple , students who play football or volleyball .
We could find out what this room is like and what the teachers do in this misterious room .
I can be closer to nuture and I have never used tents before .
My parents were very pround of me .
My hands were sclumbling but I did it very well .
I 'd like to say something that I felt during the festival , and give my opinions that would be helpul for you to prepare for the next festival .
People belive that the bird was sent from heaven .
So I am going to ask for a refund ... I hope this is n't affending you too much ...
When it comes down to color , I think it 'll be much brighter and maybe glittery .
Colors to match the clothes .
First of all , I would like to thank you for doing such a good job organising the competition which I luckely won . I have been really very impressed .
In fact I will finish my university exams only on the first of July and after the 20th it is impossible because I am going to do four weeks ' volontary work in India for UNICEF .
If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollins .
Thank you very much for your attencion on my behalf
Why have so many people been infected by this " psychologic virus " ?
We are always trying to have more things , which lead us to neglect our family , our future , and other things which are probably more important than a new perfum .
Maybe you think I am exaggerating but recent studies prouves that this mania can be really dangerous .
Certenly only the fact of having something can help people to be more sure of themselves .
Probably when Oscar Wilde said : " Superficiality is the suprem vice " he was right .
You can not imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been posticipated to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work ; as a matter of fact , after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast - food restaurant .
She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any exitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen .
I have just recieved the letter , which lets me know that I have won the first prize .
This is because I intend to take an examination in Septenber .
And recently , I have been practicing tennis as a school activity .
The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist during setting chairs just before they started practicing .
Can you send me a letter back writing what happend to you recently ?
Finally , what kind of wheather is waiting for us ?
Surprisily , there were no discounds .
She just remembered it ought to be a secret , and she became really embarassed .
I swim really well and I am a proffesional basketball player .
It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him at a concert of my favorite band .
I am writting to you about the show .
The woman who sold me a ticket was very roud to me , actually she started swearing at me .
They were just playing and , by acsident , Peter shot him .
He promised to keep it secret . The next morning we had an arguiment with Pat . The 3 of us were shouting at each other . In short , Pat left us .
Secondely , I am interested in trying something that I have never done , so I would like to do sailing .
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attemp for a whole weekend for a cheap price .
I am writing with regard to your advertisment .
It was my favorite musical .
I was very hopefull that I was going to have a good time .
The worst thing is that I could n't see my favorite actor .
I was so dissapointted about that .
I could n't consentrate on the play any more .
In contrast to the advertisment everything was disapointing .
These days we can use a computer , television and some sophisticated equipment , which were unusuall once .
Children play with computers instead of the usuall toys .
There has been a change in the relatinships between people .
We have noticed the environmential damage in recent years .
I think this festival is a great idea because it 's an opportunity to see and to appreciate art , but I also think there are some things thas could be changed .
I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted that from around the world .
This choice does n't give many artists the opportunity to expresse themselves .
I hope that my opinion can help you to organize for next year a great internation arts festival alone to young people .
I am writing to complain about a musical show on the 10th of June , and I was very disappinted .
I was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw another star that was completely different from your brochar .
According to your brochour , the show would start at 19.30 p.m. but it started at 20.15 p.m. I wanted to sleep and it was very anoying .
I was promised that after the show I could go to the theatre restaurant but due to the show starting late it aslo finished late , therefore , when I went to the restaurant they were deffinately closed .
I have a really good freind , Pat who I trusted and counted on .
One day , I fell in love with my closest freind .
We were stedy in the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well .
Personally , I wanted to keep it serets because I was afraid that we might split up .
And I would like to make sure that he relly loved me .
My boyfriend told me that he wanted to surprise his freind in his class when the time came .
One day I decided to tell my best freind - Pat , who I relied on .
I told her everything abat my boyfreind and when we met each other and evertauly fell in love .
On Monday morning , I walked into the class and all of my freind were shouting at me and calling my name and my boyfreind .
I was very ambaressed and I wanted to run out of the class .
I recived your letter and I am very excited about the camp .
I would like to go in July , I do n't mind wich two weeks , but it has to be that month because in June I am still in school and in August I am going on holiday with my family .
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it 's different from where I sleep every night so I would apreciate it if there are still tents available .
Here is where the good part starts , I was doing the courtines ( opening and closing ) when Nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him . My heart started beating very hard .
DANNY BROOK is one of my favorite actors so I decided to buy a ticket even though I had to cancel my apointment on that day at 18.30 and aslo notice of price discount impressed me .
However , when I got to the theatre , you not only did n't have any discounts but also had to apologize to us for the dalay in starting the musical .
In addition a different actor appeared on the stage and I could n't have dinner after the musical because the restrant was closed .
It made me so dissapoint and angry .
You should return my money immedeastry because that night was far from parfect .
When all the money had gone from a bank , nobady was there except Pat .
Then the police realized who the bank robbers were and arested them .
I 'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter , so referring to the question of when I would like to travel , I would like to go anytime during July , because I have to be back home in August , because I need to apply and get everithing sortted out , to go to college next September .
And referring to the question about wich type of accommodation I prefer , I choose a log cabin , because I think that a tent is messier , so I would appreciate it if you give me a cabin .
And my answer to the question about wich activities I would like to choose , well I choose swimming , because it is my daily excercise , and surfing .
And well , Mrs Helen , I would really apprecciatte it if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions .
Yours trully
Well here in Dublin things are still the same , but I think somebody told you that I went to the Moby concert here at the Point , wich is the big venue for events and concerts . I guess it was the best concert I 've ever been to , but the coolest thing is that , well do you remember my friend Luke , the one that works as a security guard ? Well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage , so I went to help them and everithing else , and when I got to the Point , do you know who was there ?
Can you believe it , it was Moby . So I went to say hello to him , and he asked me , ' Would you give me a hand with my decks ? ' So I went , and when we finished he gave me a T - shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row . Oh my God , Kim , that was the best thing that ever happened to me . Well Kim , I hope to recieve a letter from you soon , and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything , thank you .
It is wonderful for me to have the opportunitie to visit Camp California in the U.S.A.
I think this topic is so exciting from the antropological and psicological point of view , because we can studie the subject 's reactions before , during and after shopping .
For men and women appearance is important and they spend a lot of money buying clothes , cosmetics , accesories , jewellery etc .
I think in the near future we need to decide with the goverment
which special place in the town will be lefet just as a comerical area , but of course with all the facilities to get there , like a big supermarket and mall centre , from different areas of the city .
IN ADITION TO THIS , I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET .
Firstly , the actor was supposed to be Danny Brook , but he was not , it was another actor , who I have never seen before , so , as you can imagen , I was very disappointed .
Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she had done , but Pat refused to apologaising to her , because she felt it was n't a mistake and she did it for only one reason : to help Maria to get the man that she loved .
First of all , we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderfull trip with an interesting programme .
It is a coinsidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage of .
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have authograps from .
I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for authopraps .
It may , in many cases , not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately contected to it .
The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival I attended last weekend .
Firstly , I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic , but in your advertisement it said that I would find stars and artists from arround the world , when , in fact , they were from only six countries .
Secondly , I belive you should know that a lot of people , including me , were not able to enjoy the concerts because some concert halls were too small .
Last but not least , I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separatelly .
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we will be using .
This is because people wo n't give up the great taste of food . Although it could be subsituted with a vitamin pill or two .
Lastly , I think that all these changes wo n't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptedly .
Some people think that being a famous person is a very excuiting thing , that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .
I believe that if somebody wants fame and glory he must be tottally clear about the results .
Another succesfull carreer such as , film stars must also be balanced .
If somebody wants to be famous of cource they must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her .
It does n't matter what kind of carreer or job you have .
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you for the great opportunity you are giving us , especially in planning all this programme in such an acurate way .
Also , this show is free ( another positiu point ) .
I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars into aereoplanes ...
In conclusion , I strongly believe that the house of the future will be the house of a new awareness . It will be a very positiu point for opening up our lives .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has been changed considerably by rapdily developing mordern technology .
Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their lives have been far easier than before .
I was enthusiatic about receiving your letter . I will give you all the necessary information .
You ca n't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert . Apart from the musicists and the singers , there are people who work with lights , who organize the security ... it was so exciting !
I 've recived your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax and to leave the city , which is very extressing .
I can travel in July only because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it 's the mounth he can give me one , so I hope that is n't a problem for you .
I would prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent , that 's , in my opinion , a way to be nearer the enviroment and the animals , although I do n't mind staying in log cabins .
To sum up , everything you do in small cuantities is good and fun , but do n't encrease the amount you do if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .
Well my friend , I have to go , because I have got an appoinment with the Dentist .
How much mone do you recommend me to bring with me ?
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsie .
I had to buy my dress , its accesories and also clothes and souvenirs !
Thank you for choosen our ticket at the final .
It would be great if we could choosen swimming and golf .
Finally , we would like to know when you will send us the airline tickets and the tripbrochure .
You are interessted in my last job ! I really want to tell you all about my experience .
In addition , it was nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and houndreds of Coblights in the right place .
Finally , we worked the hohl night befor the concert .
We had to adjust the laser extremly carefully to get it in the correct position .
Finally you said there was a Restaurant , but it was closed , so we could n't eat anything untill we got home .
I have choosen these activities because these days I am playing on the university team , and photography is my favoorate hobby .
Is it necesarilly to bring any money ?
I am writen to you to tell you about my experience at a pop concert .
It began when our mutual friend Martha ofered me the chance to help organise the concert . Obviously I accepted .
Now I can tell you that it was an amaizing challange for me because I had never done anything like that .
My duties as a staff member were various . The firts day I had to pick the bands up from the airport , and for this I hired a van .
I am very disappointed because the things that were writen in the advertisment were not really true .
It was writen that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Danny Brook is one of my favorite actors and there appeared a different one .
I felt very disapointed .
The musical should have begun at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 ; this is inacceptable !
As you say in your advertisment , it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back .
On the other hand , the main disadvantage is that using modern machines can be very difficult for ederly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries trained people to use modern technologies .
I 'm writting to you to thank you for the excellent programme for our English class in London , especially for the river trip to Greenwich . It will be a great experience for us .
But the students in our class have seen an adverstisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " , which will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall , London , on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 . At the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show .
Please let us know as soon as you make your decission .
This book helps us to impove our logic , mind , and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie , to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much .
In fact , shopping can have some disavantages for different reasons :
It became scencial to doing my homework .
The place I 'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin , where I 'm sure I 'd feel more confortable than in a tent .
I think I 'm not bad at painting either ; at least everyone in my family likes my work , includying myself .
If it is possible I want a log cabin for my accommodation because I have been suffering with my back since my childhood , therefore I need a confortable place to sleep .
I selected swimming because it is a cure for my backace and I have not done it since I started my new job five years ago .
On the other hand , shopping can be disenjoyable .
Peter and Sue asked Francis for some help with their exam subjets and Francis , all week , was too busy to help them .
I looked at her and she became pale and suddently left the class .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisment about a fashion and leisure show in London . It will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
So , it would be greatful if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
At that time he was unconcious . I kept asking myself ' Should I wake him up or try to use my dubious first aid skills to help with him . "
Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget .
I start thinking about what she or he prefers and I try my best to buy something apropiate no matter how much money it costs .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depending on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing .
I AM WRITING WITH REFERENCE TO THE LONDON TRIP WE ARE MAKING PRERY SOON .
WE ARE REALY INTERESTED IN THIS SHOW .
WE THINK IT IS A GREAT OPORTUNITY , BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW , WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF SHOW IN THIS CITY .
IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAMME , WE SUGGEST GOING TO THE SHOW ON TUESDAY AND ON WENSDAY , INSTED OF FREE TIME , VISITING THE SCIENCE MUSEUM .
YOURS SINCERLY ,
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOUSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE AREA VERY WELL BECAUSE ALL THE TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF AT THE COURNER OF MY STREET . BUT THAT DAY , AS I WAS KIND OF DRUNK , I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE . SO , WHEN I NOTICED IT , THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF , BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO .
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS , BUT HE JUST SEID SORRY .
I WAS REALY SCARED .
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUN BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ASK THEM THE WAY .
AFTER FILLOWING HIM FOR 10 MINUTES , I STARTED TO RECOGNISE THE PLACE , AND I WAS FEELING MORE CONFORTABLE .
Definetely , it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate it if it is possible to have my money back .
I thought that Dany Brook , who is my favorite actor , would perform in that show .
Please , if you would be so kind correct this mistake . I would be gratefull if you could correct too that show starts at 20.15 not on 19.30 .
Another thing was that there were no discounts available , and that the restaurant , which I wanted to visit after the show , was closed because of the main cook sikness .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I knew that he 's a very talkative person , but it was nessesery because I wanted him to be the main organiser of that birthday party for tenes .
I made beautifull invitations for all of Agatha 's friends with a note : " Do not tell Agatha about this . This is a suprise party for her . Please keep the secret ! " Pat arranged a great DJ and drinks .
My friend and I made the perfect decorations with ballons and other party stuff .
It was so exaiting ! ! !
Enyway the disco was great , music also .
And your last festival was very intresting too .
But also there are some notes that you should improve in next year 's festival to make it absolutelly wonderful .
I think that one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is an exellent idea because it is n't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event , and with this ticket you can visit everything you want .
So the main rule in our school is regarding theachers .
I have choosen as my activities surfing and photography .
How is the wheather in California ?
Afterwards , I felt tired and unsatisfy with the store .
I 'm very happy that I won first prize in your competion .
I can come to USA in July becouse in August I will be working with my father .
You offer a great veriety of activities .
I have qustions too .
People alwas queued for stuff from the west .
Nowadays we have capitalism , free market , lots of privete shops , markets and supermarkets .
They are imported from enother Western European country .
I apprieciate these shops for lots of products , cheap prices and big spaces .
On Friedy evening and on the weekdays all supermarkets are crowded .
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you told me I have won first prize in your competion .
Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know some further information about travel and accomodation .
For istance , it is fun to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a T - shirt although you do not buy anything .
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED . I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE OVER ALL . REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY .
PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING ( ASPECIALLY IN POLAND , WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED ) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HIPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS , MOTORBIKES OR COMPUTERS .
ANYWAY EVERYBODY SHOUD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT , NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE .
Furthermore , I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fasinative for art and enjoy taking photographs of wildlife .
Sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time , but I 've got a good excute !
What a surprise ! And unbelieveable , I was responsible for looking after the pop stars .
But , I got through it . I had to take care of them during the break , serving drinks , clothes , I even brought them some cigaratte and anything they wanted .
What I most appreciated was that they gave me their latate CD with their signatures . Marvellous thing ! And of couse , as you have seen , I 've given one to you .
I 'm sorry but I am very dissapointed with the show .
We arrived on time but the show was delayed untill half - past eight .
Moreover , we were n't given any disscount for beeing students .
Maybe the eason for that is very simple : lack of money ?
It may sound funny , but mud , gravel and snow lying on the school floors is not a nice sight , so we change our schoes without questioning that rule .
Also , in Augost I will be studying a summer course in English .
Also , I felt wonderful when I saw that the concert was a success and every day it was croweded .
All the students would be very greatful .
We call home the place where we live or the country where we come frome .
Working long hours , doing plenty of activieties , going out , going on holidays .
Propably in the future we may be too busy to go to our own home and spend some time there .
Finally , we went to the restaurant in your theater after the show .
It was closed because of the staff trainning .
It is believed that our lifestyle has been changed by mordern technology such as computers and washing machines etc .
First of all , dishwashers are very effecient for me because I work full - time and look after my children .
In my opinion , morden technology makes our life easier .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . That was why our great plan for our horiday was not be real .
It happened last summer . We planned to go on holiday in the Southen part of Thailand by motorbike but we could n't tell our parents because they would n't allow us to go .
Whlile I was standing on the beach , suddenly I heard someone call my name and say that I had to go home . That is right , it was my mum .
I am writing in reply to your letter I received yestarday .
' As I have a choise I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions .
Last year I took part in a photograher 's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the cathegory of , , beautiful scenery '' .
But you could give me a chance to get more familier with it .
Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want , looking throug shelves and not finding that in the end .
Moreover , you could face an agressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager .
These are some points I want to mention about the differencies between what the advertisement said and the realities .
It was so boaring to wait for the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
It was the most imperfect evening out I ever exprienced .
It took quite a long time to adjust to the multi culture in the language institue .
Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together on the weekend usally .
And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afteroon .
I am writting to thank you for your letter confirming that I won the first prize in your competition .
But I have finally got around to writing and you 'll see that it 's definitely been worth waiting for as I have some great and unbeliavable news to tell you .
You will see why I 'm describing it as the most unforgettible one when you read through my letter .
She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert by a singer who is a well - known pop star as well as my favorite .
Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my whole life
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect that .
Second , the show started at 20:15 , althoug I read that it would start at 19:30 !
How has modern techology changed my daily life ?
When Thomas Adison invented electric light , it was the greatest invention for people of that centure .
I mean , almost everyone now has a car , a computer , a mobil phone and even an airplane .
Coocking has become faster with the help of the microwave .
They become lazy because they know that they can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a boton .
This would be a great opportunity for us because we are all intrested in clothes , sports and fashion .
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective , and he finally solves the mistery .
And another question is what are the prices of things like there , which I want to know so that I can make a better buget for my trip .
The place where we worked was a football pitch ; we spent 3 days setting up the stage , the equitment , and the lights .
I only put the speakers in the right places , or helped the engieners test the lights .
But in the breaks and after work , I had a chance to talk with the engieners , and I leant something about setting up the equitment .
Finally , the day of the concer came .
After the concer finished successfully , I was happier than ever because the success inclueded my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life .
According to your advertisement , the starrings were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE .
I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings , but on the day I saw it , a different actor performed .
Before using e - mail , I used to write letters and sometimes used the telephon .
Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes doing nothing .
If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago , you 'll notice that there are incredably big differences between them .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scarely .
There was no discount at all , which was in contrast with ' Discounts Availabe ' .
Concerning the fashion of the future , I think it depends on people 's personalities and they develope their own styles which suit them the most .
As for the colours , I think metalic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .
As different kinds of farbics will be invented and the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen .
Maybe paper can also be a farbic used to make clothing and for those who like to wear new clothes every day .
While I 'm stayin there I would like to practise tennis and basketball , as I have been playing both sports all my life , and I have to say that I am very good at both .
And that is allways what we want .
A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out .
I 'm writing to you inform you about the dissapointing evening I had when I went to your theather to see the play called " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
According to the advertisement you published , there should have been some important differents to the production I saw .
Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theather to cheat your customers . If you do that , there will be no bussiness for you and no satisfaction for them .
I look fordwad to hearing from you
Emilio Almodar , 18 years old , University Student , and the career I have choosen is in Internacional Commerce or Market .
In addition to this we use the net to comunicate with some friends we have in the U.S.A. It 's really amazing .
Maybe some people will be nakid .
Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of wheather do you have in California ?
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you , no one to talk to and no one to complaine to .
That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in small stores , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about .
I am writting in reply to your letter . I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I have got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays in these months .
Regarding the accomodation , I would prefer a tent becase it is more appropriate to a camp .
And regarding the activities , I must choose Photography and Painting becase I am not very good at sports and I think I do well at these things .
Here I am , writting to you to tell you everything about my wonderful experience at the concert .
When the concert started , I was preparing some drinks for the band because after the concert they would be very tired and tersty .
In order to celebrate the 125th aniversary of the city , the Coun Council organised an open air concert .
Although I was very nervious , I knew I could do the job well .
I am writing to express my dissapointment with the play " over the rainbow " , which is showing at the Circle Theatre .
Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an agressive employee refused to answer me .
Defineteley , I want my money back as soon as possible .
So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and extremely agressive .
But , well , the unhappiness started with Pat and my reveilled secrets .
Organise your shows better and do not exagerate with publicity !
Despite this , I 'm convinced all this progress has caused some damage to the community , not only phisically .
Finally , everyone should slow down his own life 's rythm .
Second of all , the play was suposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
To finish my " marvelous " evening , I wanted to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .
I was punished , nearly expelt , but Pat did n't receive any punishment .
According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all .
One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook 's participance .
To make matters worse , the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisment was closed .
So I did n't have such a perfect evening as was promised in your advertisment .
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be gratefull if you could give me back a part of my money .
On the one hand , the Internet is often used for entertaiment , but on the other hand it 's also used in different business and education processes .
If we are talking about accomodation then accomodation in tents would be great - I love being close to nature .
I am not talking about some kind of achivements in those discipines but they are my big pasion
Unconected part of all people 's lives is shopping .
As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping .
It 's like , , walking in the clouds , , you feel like you are flaing .
Choosing gives me such great pleasure because I never have to worry about vere I get money for my wishes .
It 's hard for me even to emagine a situation when shopping is not enjoyable .
Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly and you ca n't have it .
I hope your questions have been answered appropriatly .
Instead of tranditional telecommunications , we can talk by , e - mail or even see each other with the help of a computer network .
Among the large number of choices , this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view from the top of its towers , a charming story and one of the most representative examples of Catalonian modernisme art .
We looked at every hotel in town , trying to give you the best offerd .
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very cassual clothes .
Finally , on the last day I sugget you go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around .
The aim of this report is to recomend you to visit the Fuerte de San Diego Musseum .
I asked some pleople in town and this was the best place to choose .
The Fuerte de Sandiego Musseum was built at the time when the Spanish people were trying to take all the lands from Mexico , one of the most important people who was at front of the Fuerte was Hernon Cortez , the first Spanish in have more lands than anyone at that time .
The Musseum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco .
This invention has made our lives easier and quickier .
Service : It is over 100 years old but it is kept in good condition by the local people , who are proude of this castle .
It is a different expirience .
History : At the castle there are always a few guides , who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle ( when it was built , by whom and why ) , which makes everyone enthousistic .
I recomment visiting this castle , because it is interesting , marvelous and something different .
Nyremberg is also famous for this castle and the students will have a different expirience and a lesson too .
Finally , there are a lot of mouseum in our town . Therefore , I would suggest going to the frogs museum , which is really fashinating .
subject : Arboriginal Art Museum .
The aim of this report is to discribe the biggest building of our town .
b ) The building was buit in 1999 . Therefore , it is an example of modern architecture .
In addition to this , we have chosen the luxuery Palace Hotel , which is comfortable enough and in a good location .
Cars , boats , motobikes , airplanes : Who has never used them once ?
In this world , where the nations fight to be the best one could n't be diferent , the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
The best way is definetely by air .
Thank you for your lettre .
The bus will pick you up right at your hotel entery .
You do not have to wear spezial clothes , just wear what you always wear .
On the top of the tower it has a huge clock on eatch side .
It was rebuilt in 1948 because of the Secound World War , when it had been demaged .
The tower is absolutly marvelous .
I receved your letter and I 'm happy to help you . We booked the Palace Hotel for your group . It 's nice and quiet .
When you go out of the hotel turn right and go stright on ; turn right again at the first crossroads .
In the big room where we 'll have the party , there 'll be some picturs of our college . You 'll see all the generations who passed through here .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube . The location of the conference is then five minutes by footh .
For the party I suggest you wear classic clothes ; maybe something black and not red or pink . I am going to wear classic black trousers and a white jorsey - it might be that this information gives you some idea too .
I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown is n't well and hope he 'll get better soon . I am more than happy to give you the nessessary information .
Regarding what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you take the students to our History Museim .
There is also a gift shop in there , where your boys and girls can buy some soveniers for their families and friends .
More and more people are learning how to drive and choosing to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport .
You do n't have to wait at a bus stop in cold and windy weather for a late bus , or be stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs . You can just jump into a car , tune your radio to your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation .
I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutelly love it !
I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music , as I brought some cassets with me from Thailand .
I took a driving - theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a pratice driving test very soon .
It is called the Palace Hotel , and we hope that it is going to meet your expectetions .
I strongly reccommend you to use public transport in order to get there , because you may find other types of transportation quite expensive .
Moreover , you must be aware of the fact that the conference is going to last two hours , untill 10:00 pm .
After that our college has organised a barbequiou night , with traditional local music that you must not miss .
I hope that you will find my information helpfull .
THE HYSTORICAL MUSEUM
Without any doubt , it is a hystorical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passing of the centuries .
Do n't miss the chance to visit the hystorical museum , located in the heart of the capital city .
The hystorical museum is simply a symbol , a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle : their freedom .
There are five diffrent floors , each of them presents a diffrent chronical period of Greek history , starting from the period before the birth of Juisus and concluding with the revolution of 1967 .
Inside the museum there is a bookshop with a large variety of hystorical books , maps etc .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the hystorical museum ! ! !
When you are in the bus station you will catch bus number 37 , which will go to the town center .
Anyway the college is the first road on your right from the town center .
Architecture : It is a typical from this epoque with beautiful drawing on the wall and first kind of writing in the sports center .
They decided to build more schools , especially in Switzerland because the people there were considerated clever .
The people who will attend the party include many professers , semi - professers and faculties .
Firstly , there is the acquerium in the building .
I hope when you visit you will be favorite place .
Firstly , Palace Hotel has been booked for the group 's accomodation and I spoke with the hotel manager about travelling to the conference .
I am writing in reply to your letter about the internation student conference .
And the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach , as there are about 35 internation students , and they are all strangers here .
A big Buhha was built in 1997 just next to the temple , and it is the largest outdoor Buhha in the world .
It is easy to get there and free amittion .
On the other hand , Hong Kong is known as a highly commerical city , and you could find something different in Po Lin Temple .
To hear the voice of the person you love is a feelling that is hard to describe ; it 's wonderful and so real . You can imagine their face clearly .
I had a problem with my best friend once when we kept in tuch through e - mail .
With reference to the information that you have requested , the hotel that has been booked is the Holiday Inn , in New Port and to get to the University of Wales , wich is not far from the hotel , you only need to take a divertion where clearly indicate Carleon and once you are on the main road , all you need to do is to follow the country road which takes you directly to the place .
As for the last day , I would suggest you make a visit to the locall museum and the ruins of the Castle .
In the first you will find a very intresting collection of Roman remains , also you can visit another section wich is supoused to be a Roman site .
I always had considered myself to be very looky to be born in the century because of all the amaizing human inventions .
However , I feel that at the moment there should emerge more grups to control this development because of the industrial polution that has been created and it seems that it 's very little , what is being done at the moment in relation to our embiroment .
I think that it will be nice for the end - of - conference party if you invite somebody to sing and give the students the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance .
First of all we need the telephone in our house because it 's important to make a call if you need something or if something happend to your house and nobody is with you .
In the past people did n't have electicity and if they wanted , for example , to read or to cook something they used to light a fire .
You must have a TV because you can liten about what is happening in the world and you can see some places that you haven't been to .
I 'm very glad to be able to help you out with such a sutiation .
At the same time you are enjoying the castle you can take a breake to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea . That is also amazing .
Yours sincerley ,
I am writting to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conferents and other points in relation to it .
With the Internet you can comunicate with people in different places of the world at the same moment .
I am writing to inform you that I have recieved a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college .
For those students who are very interested in shopping , clothes shops , jewellery , stationery , bookshops , fashion and beauty departments and many more are availiable .
For those who want something more exciting and advanturous , you are recommanded to visit the Fun Fair and amusement arcade on the top floor of the building .
I am writting in connection with your letter about the international student conference .
You will never regred about my suggestion .
If you need more information let me knowe .
I 've recieved your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you are going to organise very soon . Here you have a little help for it .
First , I 'd like to tell you that the hotel where you are going to stay is " The Palace Hotel " , wich is situated at the center of the town .
It is a well - situated town with a lot of museums to visit , especially " the History Museum " , wich I visited last year , and I think you will enjoy it .
It 's imposible Nowdays to imagine a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business .
The answer was always the same : " Imposible " .
An old woman told me how important the phone was when her only son was abroad studing computers at " Chicago University " . She told me that every night she expected a call from her son , because her was the line of the hapiness .
However , there was one persone wich told me he was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to writte a lot , especially at Christmas when he wanted to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phones him , ending a very old tradition .
Firstly , about your accomodation , the college which I belong to offers visitors free accomodations with full of facilities
This party is unlikely to be that formal , but I recommend you do n't wear jeans and trainners .
I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it and maybe become familier with our culture .
These days , we 're sorrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented .
Let us try to appreciate thier importance again .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definetly need one and that holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistics on your computer to do social research and some analysys .
My professor said , ' Go and get familier with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail ' .
I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we useually use without thinking .
At the end of the conference there will be a reseption at the hotel .
Lots of books , papers , lots of things on the tabels .
Computers have helped to improve health because in this century we can use them in medical operations . Doctors can manage the most extreme operation easyly and confedantly .
No matter where you are , what you do , apparantly , you need electricity .
For your last day I think it would be interesting to vistit our historic and famous city centre .
People now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend their leassure time , to relax , or just to see something different than their home .
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is situated in the city center , 15 minutes ' walk from where the conference takes place .
The group has been booked into a comfortabel and well - situated hotel , whose name is the " Palace Hotel " .
Naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but something that is special is our cathedrale .
Finally , I am sure you and your group will spend some enjoyable , realaxing days here .
It is well known in almost all families , often with a lot of different cannels .
I can not imagine living without televison , it is something that we need for our education , and for getting news and other helpful information .
Nowdays everyone has a telephone .
Nowadays we are very bussy and we do n't have free time to see our friends , but we can call them and talk or chat with them .
The telephone is a very important invention if we can use it correctly without using it as a type of entertaiment as many people do nowadays .
However , if you 're interested in Archeology you should vitis the History Museum in Garden Square .
In the last fourty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using their car .
In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring our lugguage and shopping bags .
For example , in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to choose from .
On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe us to get about quickly .
There are eye - max cinema , museums , a garelty .
Pusan Castle is locted in the South of Pusan .
It was built four hundread years ago .
With reference to your letter which I recived yesterday , I would like to give you some details about the international student conference , also the acomodation and activities that are planned during this week .
I hope this letter aswer all your questions , if you whant to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter .
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resart buildings which were built 10 years ago . They are some of the first buildings that were built with the latest tecnonology and designed by an important Mexican arquitector .
In addition , the resort has an interesting historical background concerning the arquitectory and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico , for example , it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico .
In spite of the disadvantages , I would strongly recomended students and the public to visit the new Acapulco resort buildings and have a great experience learning about the buildings ' history and at the same time travelling around Mexico .
For the end - of - conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us with live music and cattering .
Finally , to fill your free afternoon I would definitely recomend visiting the cathedral and having a walk arround the old part of the city . If you want , it will be my pleasure to show you the area .
Chairs are not only part of the forniture , they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums where they are art objects .
The world is packed with so many tipes of chairs , from the common woden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a basic range of prices .
From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most usefull gadget ever invented .
Some people use them in their work , others wish to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of mouvement .
I phoned the tourist information office last week and I got some information about the accomodation for the students .
As requested , the aim of this report is to assess the suitbility for a group of American students of the visit to the Etruscan Museum .
It contains lots of archeological Etruscans founded and some remains from the Estruscans ' neoropolis .
Also there are some free handphones that explain the history of the museum .
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , I strongly reccomend it for their excursion and because of their interests .
In my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line .
Basicaly , during three hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London .
Are you always happy when your telephon rings ?
Since I have been travelling around the world , I would have imagined beeing in touch with my family or friends without the Internet or my mobile phone .
This is an International student party , so I suggest you wear tradional costume .
You can inform all the students that they can take some tradional food to the party .
It inculds a labrary ,
II suit , academic rooms , a GYM Club and a restuarant .
There is a very big labrary .
Just in the same building , you can find a restuarant .
They can also talk with British students to communiate study experience .
The group has been booked into the " Maria Luisa " Hotel , which is situated in the center of Wimbledon called Wimbledon Village .
The purpose of this report is to give a brief discription of the Academy of Art in St Petersburg .
This building is situated on the magnificent bank of the Niva River with an exellent view of the Hermitage Museum .
The building was built by a very famious Russian architect and is a marvellouse example of Russian classic architerture of the XVIIIth century .
In the Academy of Art you can find the oldiest art libarary , with a wide range of books , and the Museum of Russian Art , with a huge collection of paintings , sculpture and architectural projects from the early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries .
For example , I work for a bank , and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director living 800 kilometers away , and he does n't have to come here , we just have a phone conference where everybody can talk , and that is it !
Finally , on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museam because this museam is the biggest in the world now . It is up to you .
for Example , THAILAND , the United States of America , INDONISIA and CANADA .
Therefore I am thinking of selling my car , which has changed my life over the last 10 years , which has given me a kind of freedom , which has gone with me to all sorts of fantastic places , and changed my life for a new life : whithout a car .
Finally we enjoy a disco party so you should wear a suiteable dress .
So he crimbed on the radder up to the window and he opened the door but policemen came there " what happened ? "
Jane expained that situation and they understood her .
I am writting to give you the information that you asked me for .
From there you can get a taxi , catch the number seven and eleven buses , wich both take you very close to the conference centre , and also you can go by underground to get there .
Then , after the Conference , there will be a formal party at the group 's hotel , wich starts at 9:00 pm and finishes at 12:00 midnight .
Yours Sincerelly
Hampton Court Palace is localizated in Hampton Court .
For the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel . Then we all set off to go on a sightseeing tour of Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for the airport .
Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London .
We definately need light to keep on . I dare say , without light , our life would go into a dark , dark hell .
I am writting to you to answer your question about the conference in London . Thank you for your letter .
I would like to inform you that the group you belong to has been booked into the Palace Hotel in the center of London from the 24th of June until the 25th of June .
Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlman a dark suit .
1 ) " Fontana di Trevi " sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome .
1 ) First of all , they are located in the center of Rome so they can take a bus to get to them move and around the city .
Regarding your last question I can sugest visiting the Royal Castle .
Actually it is a whole complex , the Old and the New Castle , the Cathedrall and the very interesting undergroud part with its amazing crypts .
And if you climb to the top of the main tower - the keep - you will see unforgetable views of a white toun .
You will find there an amazing collection of old weapons , armores and , we are especially pround of it , the great collection of swords .
After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurands located at the New Castle .
I am sure that should be enought for a one - day trip .
Please note that alchocholich drinks are only sold untill 11 pm .
Coming back to ideas and Suggestions , I 've promised to give you a free afternoon befor you catch your plane . I would advise you to visit our zoo or to go for a picnik in a park befor you go to the party .
Such simple and everyday things like a telefone , a car , a computer only seem to be normal and everyday for us as we use them every day .
These inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared , but not everyone beleives it is really so .
First of all they talk about the enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles create , overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some other problems .
I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people 's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it does n't matter where you are ( I am talking about mobile phones , which a majority now have through choice ) .
I think it would n't be possible for us to survive without eclectric light .
Because of shipbuilding developments people were able to make all those geographical discoveries , and automobile transport is an undenyable neccecerity in our life .
Because of everything I have said I am more likely to think that the benefits of peopel 's inventions are much greater than all their disadvantages .
If you have any further questione , please do not hesitate to contact me .
SUBJECT : Recomnendations for a place to visit
The place I would like to recommend is the seventienth - century Royal Palace .
The Old Town is the best place for an afternoon stroll , with a great deal of restaurants , caffes and street performers .
There are a number of hotels or youth hostels to stay overninight , if necessary .
I am plece to provide the information you need for the group .
The hotel I booked is the Palace Hotel wiche is in the center of London just two blocks from Victoria station .
I think it is very convenit for the group . You know the Victoria area , it is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city . About the hotel , it is clean , and provides a good service . The rooms are dobuels and neche has its own bathroom and for the nomber of students we are getting good Valud . And the best way to get to the College for the conference is to walk to Victoria station , get the tram to Glouster Road and after 3 blocks on the left - hand side you will find the College .
Howeve I am goign to make a plan for acche student with all of the diteil and the adres .
About the party at the end of conference , we are organising it in the same hotel whict has a nice salon .
It will be good for yor group because you do n't need to move to anoder place .
It is not a formal party so I think it is faind to wear somethig not too formal .
I whant to suggestions for the last day . You and your group could maybe go to Green Park and visite the Queen 's house and Parlamente , this area is very nice and the group would engoin aftha the conference to get some Freche air . Another obction could be the new Tell Gallery . I have never been there but it could be a good esxuse to visit it with you .
I have been hearing about the Ave they have in the Exivicuion , it is interesting .
I hope you found thes letter uselfuel and if you have any questions , let me know .
I am looking forway to seeing you soon .
Yoors sincerely
The computer was invented 30 years or mor ago and estart procesing information with a big card which was perfored and made a smol hole and aeche hole meant something like a code .
The maching that was used for reading this card was very big , you used to need a room for the computer .
I remember when I had the first lesson at the Univerty and the ticher took us to the Computer Center and I saw these machins , all my colleagues and I were lofing was very dificul to imagine how you can work with this kind of computer .
These days the computer is part of your life , you use it all the time . Sometimes you do personal and anoder times it is just the thingh you need to do like go to the bank , use transpor , go shopping etc . It is a maching that makes life easy and ibendow you can cari it everywhere . It is amaising the way as the fas the computer changes , the programas are faster and more useful and practical .
But the computer has a bad side too . I whand mean we life aeche day we depende mor and mor on it .
So I feel ascere when I think about the consercuencias if some of the viruses or mad people misuse as hapen thise days with sex or other .
I work with children and the computer helps me in my job but affeted it too .
So I hope the world reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent these probleme because something good could be something very dangerous .
Both of them are as convinience as getting there .
End of all , in my opinion we could go to the center of the town because there are many places to have a look at and go shopping .
So that 's why they have invented the telephon .
Take the bus in the direction of the center of town .
With the computer , we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writting the whole letter again . We save the letter and in three weeks we could send it to another person .
If we had n't ay , we would have to write all the transactions on paper .
I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accomadation of the group and it will be quite easy to get everywhere on foot from the hotel during your stay .
There is no need to bother about clouths .
Befor you leav England , I suggest you visit the cannals and small villages around Basingstoke . You could have the opportunaty to see the country life .
Would n't it be unbarable and painful ?
Ceartainly it would be just like mine .
Because I live in a rural area , far from any village , town , or city center .
But also I 'm aware that time flies for me . I must do whatever I want befor it is too late .
And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most usefull invention for humanity .
As you need more information , I will answer all your questions with plesuare .
It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our sity and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college , so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot .
Finally , you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historic places ( castles built in the 13th century ) or art galleries , as well as the beatiful Bodnant Garden .
I think that one of the most importent inventions affecting our life is the telephone .
I have just received the letter from you and I 'm writting to you as soon as posible .
The best way to get from there to the conference is by coache , which I have arranged for you .
Then we can have a rest in the caffee and talk before your flight home .
I think I have given you all the importen information .
Nowdays motorization is one of the most important inventions .
When you look amoung everybody has a car or motorcycle .
No matter that people started worred more about polution in the world .
I love motocycles and I do n't think I could live without them .
I have ridden a motocycle since I was 16 years old .
We rode motocycles for a few days befour we finally got to our mitting points .
I really enjoy riding my motocycle .
When I ride it is only me and my motocycle .
I am really greatful to the people who invented the first motocycle in the world .
To sum up , I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers , which has affected both indivisuals and society as a whole .
Personly I recommend the Dickens tour because it is a good length walk and very historical .
The bus leavs at 8 a.m. from the front entrance of the hotel .
The end - of - conference party is in a tent and in the greenground .
It will be a surprice !
On the last afternoon you could go on a city tour , visite the Museum of Fine Arts , or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the public park .
The museum is near the city center and is accessible by bus or walking .
It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building , approximetively one mile away .
The increasing number of cars related and infrastructure is now creeting problems .
A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded , and enviromment problems are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries .
People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the enviromment without affecting their mobility .
If you are free I will show you arround our college .
The countless fascinating things will definely take you the whole day to appreciate .
I love baking cakes , cockies and breads .
However , there is something about which it is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention .
In my opinion , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most machines , appliances and equipment which are used in modern times can only be operated with electricity , which makes people not do too much phisical labour .
Dar Mrs. Maria Smith ,
I hope that our friend Richard Brown does n't have any serious willness .
This party is for the students so the clouthes wo n't be so formal .
We can chouse between two options for spending our free time .
I do n't like tinking of my house or my life without all these facilities .
Now , you just need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city , with a car , aeroplanes , shoops , all these things without lights .
It is surposed to be from 7 pm to 11 pm .
I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some questions , please do not hestitate to contact us .
Lots of great inventions have been invented in order to help people live comfortablely .
Because there are a lot of beatiful trees and you can see the sea .
By the way , the end - of - conference party is a kind of fairwell party .
The first part , the chairman and a few guests will give a speech and the second part , the participacients will evaluate themselves , and the last part will consist of dinner and drinks .
For example : electricity , the computer , telephon , boat , and car ( wheel ) , etc .
It has abosolutly reduced women 's housework time .
She appears occationaly and opens every window in the castle .
I would suggust they wear formal clothing , such as tie , trousers and blaser .
The building is called the Chiang Kei - shek Momerial Hall .
The momerial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds .
As you go into the main Hall , you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei - shek . This is because the building is the rememberence of how well Chiang did in History .
Apart from the main Hall , there are also lots of other gallaries .
In these gallaries there are Historical paintings and antique furniture which Chiang used .
there are also restaurants and modern gallaries .
When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat , or if you are fed up with historical things , you migh as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern .
Finally , if you want to visit this building I would recommend you stay at a hotel not far from the momerial Hall called the Hyatt Hotel .
OLYMPIQUE MUSEUM
The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offers , for the tourist , an unbelievable view of the mountains and the lake .
I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holliday in Yverdon .
It is a modern hotel , near our college , and it is also very convenent for the airport . You can take either bus or taxies .
The nember 101 bus leaves from the airport , then you can get off at the " city college " stop .
Nowdays people have become used to watching television programmes every day .
Someone is talking , laughting , crying on there , so join them . You will feel much better than you would just by yourself .
Some TV programmes are enjouable !
In clucsion , TV has both advantages and disagvangtages , but on the whole the advantages are greater than the disadvantages .
On the positive side , you and the group will be abe to learn more about Welsh artworks which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furniture .
And some old toilets might look awlful .
So , I 'm writting to reply to give all the information you asked for .
The best way to get from the hotel to the conference is using the tube because it takes only 20 mininute .
And your speach would be better for the end of conference party .
Some people might say electricity is more important than any other thingh .
For instance , when I want to contanct my friend , it 's quite helpful to use e - mail .
However , the computer is worth using in our life until a more coveniance machine is invented .
It also holds an internation exhibition all year round .
In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she was a litte girl there was only one telephone in the building where she lived .
It was in her parents ' appartement .
It is not an easy desicion how to react now .
thank you for your letter , wich arrived yesterday .
I hope to give you all the information you need and , please , if you want more information or somenthing is not clear , please do n't esitate to contact me again .
It 's a very confortable hotel where you can find everything you need .
From there to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus , which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town center .
For this conference I suggest wearing somenthing very confortable but elegant . The organisation wants all the men to wear a jacket , but a tie is not necessary .
If I find somenthing special you will be able to visit in three hours I will call you .
It is the most important church in this area because of its architeture .
It is somenthing very special . Its ceiling is made from many small pecis of wood . Its windows with many colours . It is fantastic .
I look farword to hearing from you
I hope that all the information you need will be provided satisfactorialy .
Secondly the best way to go from the hotel to the conference center is to use one of the shutel buses we provide at this efect .
Finaly , concerning your free afternoon , there are plenty of activities , but I suggest you visit the Caldea center , wich is a very special bath center .
If you need futher information do not hesitate to contact us .
There are plenty of churches , cathedrals , and old cotages .
The churches and the cathedral are very intesting because of their different Romanic styles .
Finaly if none of my suggestions fit with your expectations , let me know more about what kind of buildings you are interested in and I 'll do my best to find something more suitable .
To finish , if you have spare time , you could walk in the center of Poitiers which is very beautiful .
In the Pompidou center , there are different exhibitions on different themes .
So if you visit Paris , the Pompidou center is a very interesting building to visit , even if in Paris there are many other buildings .
It is situated in the center of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college , where the conference is going to be held .
I think that the best choise for you is to take the 234 bus .
Also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum .
To conclude I would like to say that the goverments of all developed countries would n't have been so concerned about the so - called " problem 2000 " if the computer had not been so important for modern society .
First , I would like to congratulate you on your new responsability , because of Mr Brown 's illness .
There , I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself .
If you go down a few steps , you will discover the ceilar .
She is looking for an interesting job , and appling to many companies .

The Thai goverment gives money to students to study for free for fifteen years . My nephews got money to buy stationery and student uniforms .
After buying anything the guardian is supposed to return the receip to the school to confirm that the money is being used for the student and not for other things .
We have never had an offer from the goverment like this before . Usually parents pay for their children to study .
I do n't know the amount that each grade recived but my nephew recived around 560 baht for this term .
I know abroad you study for free until universitry ?
That is a really good goverment who supports you .
Because it can introduce something fresh to our life , like changing your shirt color for instance .
In the past , I ostracized gays all along , because I thought that was nonnatural and abnormal , but now I have changed my mind . I do n't know the exact reason - - maybe because I am more mature , or something else . I believe that true love can exist between two men or two women .
the Highwest fashion , which acters wear often , is popular in Korea .

When you look up a word in this dictionary , it always gives you a clear definision of the word in a user - friendly layout .
I used to use a Japanese - English one ( and addmittedly still use it from time to time ) , but now I usually use the English - English one .

But that annoucement is unacceptable .
There are many rumar about that on the net .

The company produced the game lik that in case that player uses Majicon .

When a woman resists a man 's solutions he feels his competence is being qustioned .
As a result , he feels mistrusted , unapprciated , and stops caring .
He can reflet and discover how he was probably offering solutions at a time when she was needing empathy and nurturing .
Here are some brief examples of ways a man might mistakenly imvalidate feelings and perceptions or offer unwanted solutions .
Thia is what you should do . ``
Each of these statements eitheer invalidates or attempts to explain upset feelings or offers a solution designed suddenly to change her negative feelings to positive feelings .
By learning to listen , gradually he will experiece that she will appreciate him more even when at first she is upset with him .
She can reflect and discover how she was probably giving him unsolicited advice or criticism rather than simply sharing her needs , providing information , or making a requst .

The cerebral wave activity is clasified into groups , each one named with a Greek letter : Alpha , Delta , Gamma and Theta .
So , Alpha waves have a frecuency of 0 . 5 and 0 . 4 cycles per second , and they are often found in a state of deep sleep .
Theta waves have a frecuency of 5 and 7 cycles per second , and they are found in the state between wakefulness and dreaming .
Alpha waves have a frecuency between 8 and 14 cycles per second , and they are found in states of peace and a relaxed alert .
Beta waves have a frecuency of 15 and 22 cycles per second , and they are found in a state of crisis , anxiety and agressiveness .
The massive production of Alpha waves in children makes them have a great learning capacity that can even allow them to attain / achieve super - learning or acelerated learning when there is a state of peace .
On the other hand , if there is a state of agressiveness or stress , learning can not be achieved .

When the grown - up 1900 sat in front of the piano , using his slender hands ; which are smooth like the keys , the ship bouncing on the sea waves , the piano 's pulling and melodious tones , entranced by the music that he played for the poor people , my heart followed the tones up and down and the happiness on eeveryone 's face .
Someone said that 1900 is happiness . He lives with his favourite music , people surrounding him are all friendly and kind , he need n't care zbout numerous complicated things and disturbances . Is this true ? Everytime the boat draws into the shore , he looks at the island in a lonely way . He called strangers secretly with a nervous and expectant voice , `` hello , you do n't know me , but , can we have a chat ? `` . Especially when that tramp told 1900 his experience . He wanted to experience standing on the island and listen to the sea . What would that be like ? I 'm not 1900 , but I can definitely identify with his loneliness and longing - he was very keen to be on the island that he had never experienced .

Have you ever heard about the Winner winner chicken dinner ? It is an old American motto with long histroy . OK , let me tell you something about it .
It is said that in the 19 centry in american , Las Vegas had already become a fairly famous place where rich and wealthy people spend their money .
At that time , there were few casinos there but each of them provided good service for custorms to enjoy ther time there .
At firt the custormers mostly consist of the rich and famous people , but as time goes by , the economy got better , so it brought more typical people without fame or a high place in society to Vegas to try their luky .
At that time , almost every casino brought out a new service in which the custorms were able to buy a kind of dinner with chicken and some meat in it .
That was such a cheap choice for most players , so it gruadtully become an American motto : Winner Winner Chicken Dinner !

Hello , my friends . First of all , I want to apologize to all my friens at lang - 8 for being absent for this long period due to the requirements in my last year of college . No doubt that I miss you all . I pick up this topic because everybody here is talking about the referendum in sudan these days . To the people who do n't know much about Sudan , it is the biggest country in Africa and located on east side of Africa ; south of Egypt . My country has struggled with political instability and prolonged wars since being liberated from the Britich 50 years ago . Unfortunately Sudan was born with wars and the most harmful one was in South Sudan . That war is considered the longest war in the history of Africa or modern history . The war continued 50 years after liberation , killed two million Sudanese citizens , and caused four million Sudanese citizens to emigrate due to the paralyzed economy we had during this ugly war .
Sudan is a country of diffrente races , languages , and religions , but specific parts in the north are more educated than other parts of Sudan . This is because during britich rule the south and west of Sudan were closed areas and the government did n't allow any cultural developmental . So , soon after liberation the Sudanese found themslef with big challenge of how to rule this wide country where the north Sudanese were more educated . The government was ruled by them and other citizens felt like this government does n't represent them . The biggest historical mistake is that this government did not change britch policy of closed lands . As result of this huge mistake , the racism grew between Sudanese populations and rapidly the southern Sudanese took up arms to get their rights in Sudan . At that point , no Sudanese , including southern Sudanese , had the idea for a separation . They just wanted their rights in their country as whole Sudan . And , as days go by , and wars burned houses and killed children and women , the idea of separation from Sudan arose . In 2005 , the happiest year of sudan history , the government and ( splm ) stopped the war in South Sudan the Nifasha Peace Agreement has born . The goverment promised a lot political changes : the system became democratic and a successful election also occurred . sothren sudanes can rule their own lands by the new fedral system . In the Nifasha Peace Agreement , the goverment sponsored the referendum right after six years of the treaty . This period was supposed to be the rehabilitation period of the wars affect on the south . The south took more than 50 persent of the oil to rehabilitate southren Sudan by SPLA . Due to the bad situation in the south and huge corruption , not many changes took place in health and education and most of the money was spent on southren sudanes army . Due to the environment wich lacks any trust , now the 6 years is running out fast and the Sudanese face a referendum one month from now . The news is not good about the south , because a lot of politicians see the sapration as the start of a new phase of war in Sudan because most of the oil in Sudan lies in the boundaries between south and north . And these boundaries have not been defined yet , so the Sudanese are worried about witnessing another endless war . The situation is very tense and everybody is expecting the worst , but there is hope that the referendum will lead to unity . And if that occurs , it will be the true liberation of Sudan and a promising future . We pray for our children to be raised in a united Sudan without bloodshed .

I bought a fasion magazin recently , and I found a remarkable article .
People are always wonderring whether the country or the city is the ideal place to live .
The foremost reason for dwelling in the countryside is the soothing and confortable life provided by the pastoral view .
Those who have enjoyed the first cock crow in the morning , the twettering of birds in the trees and the breathtaking sight of the rising sun would go into rapture at only the mere mention of the idyllic life .
Relaxed and suburban dwellwers are able to hold a more positive attitude for life and achieve more accomplishments .
Another subtle explanation rests on the fact that country habitants are fortunate enough to enjoy the cozy and pleasant amience of the family without exhausting their social life .
On the contrary , it would be far more difficutlt to acquire such pleasure for those urbanites .
Naturally , it is possibly too reckless to assert that nothing beneficial comes from city life since several accompanying merits aslo come along with it .

Some really want to change their aggresive personality or bad atitute .

There is a comercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kinds of businesses : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , grocers , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .

Using public transport can be difficult , because we have a strict time and , normally , we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely desconfortable .
One argument for not using the car is that petrol is very expensive , but public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantange is not so good , actually .
The story took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by doctors and cientifics .
But we should n't forget the pollution cause by cars . We should use a bicycle or public transportetion more .
If we are working with sameone in the same job who lives near us or is our neighbour , we can go to work in the same car . This way we use less petrol .
The governents are also important for taking care of the environment .
In total , there were 32 pelople , a white kittie and a dog .
That night , the dog , the kittie , Tom and Michel slept in the same room , and that was n't too bad .
When Michael got up in the morning , he realized that his kittie had disapeared , and he found Tom 's dog with some white hair in his mouth .
He thought that the dog had eaten the kittie during the night , so he shouted at Tom , opened the door and went away .

The environment is our surroundings . There is no aleartness in our locality . They are busy with their own work . No one focuses on or sees what is hapening in our town . They usually speak about how hot it is today , but they do n't know what makes it this hot . I am interested in planting trees and making our sorrounding clean . Some people used to burn the forest as if the forest is useless . Man is greedy because all the things we get from the forests are free .
Managemant acountant practice is very important for an organization for making decisions about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers .
To take care of the environment , each of us has to do something such as propaganda to the people in the country . About my village , we use banana leaves instead of nilon , dispose of garbage sensibly ... and so on .

I have neded to use English a lot of times during my professional activities . For that reason I took some English lessons many years ago .
I can tell you that I feel I can understand over 90% when I 'm listening and when I 'm reading , but my main problem with English is , of course , when I have to speak . I fee terrible and without confidence . I think that I 'm always thinking in Epanish and then doing the translation into English . Maybe at this moment , while I 'm writing this composition , I 'm making the same mistake . I know that learning English is a long process , but I must follow that process because I 'd like to be an excellent bilingual person .
Currently , I 'm working as a teacher at the university and teaching in English is my gol .
I also work as a freelance worker with the same subjects because it is necessary to increase my incons .
I 'm writing now without using a dictionary and doing this composition without traduction from Espanish ( I hope hahaha )
I hope you can help me undesrtand more about how to improve my English level and develop my skills .
Thank you for your attention , and I 'll wait for your advaice , ( this is my first time writing over 50 words )
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions . This mostly happens in high class famiies , as they foccus on achievements like power , political influence etc . On the other hand , for middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as they are inherited from our ancestors in terms of values like honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .

When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you gain a lot of knowledge , culture , discorves and , with all of this , you gain personal experencie .
The job provides , like the trip , responsibility and experencie .
The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career prejudicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are too old to study at a uniersity .
Besides that , they have different points of view on many sublects , that is why they may not like the fun and the conversation in the social life with other students .
They can not enjoy this chapter with oung and fresh thoughts .
It is a big dedcision , that brings great consequences and great experencies .
AAs an example , if a student needs to recuperate a subject or has to get a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time .
They would consider you as an indpendent person .
Accrodingly , you would take responsibitity for what you did .

Eating habits in my country have really changeged in the last ten years .
it 's r is n't clear complety , but I sopuse it depends on chenging life habits in the development process of our sosiety .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he had forgotten what he had to do . After thinking , he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her in his car as the doctor 's clinic was far away from her house . Peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother 's house in the next street . After he arrived , he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the street . He apologized to her and asked her to get into the car . " Never mind " she said and got in the car beside him .
However , travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . Travelling by bus is not as convenient as getting in a car , but you can never know what might happen with your car , where it might get stuck in traffic or some other accedient might happen .

The reasons for stress are more diverse ; perhaps because we have an exam period , family proplems or because we think in a negative way , or we have destroyed ourselves through long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfort , and lots of reasons to stress ...
We must get rid of the stress quickly before we lose ourselves , because it 's very harmful . For example , you can read a book , do sport , play music , eat delicious food , remmeber all the positive things that have happened to you , talk with someone who you trust , get rid of everything that makes you upset and makes your life tiring , go out and eat a meal with your best friends , and there are a lot of things you can do ...
Remmeber that stress is not a lasting thing , and you can avoid it .

Many people believe that nowdays there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient , but others continue with the tought that they do help , for example , with travelling long distances .
The ticket does n't cost too mutch and it is avaible for the majority of people , at least compared to buying a car .
Secondly , public transport is more eficent for travelling long distance than cars and people would n't have to purchase fuel .
When people need to tavel to other continents or far away , they may need a plane , wicth is a form of public transport , to complete the journey because they have to cross oceans and clomplicated distances that have different landforms .
However , a car is something which belongs to the person and he can do wathever he wants and find it in the same state he left it in , and sometimes public transport vehicles are n't left in the best way .

We fisited a lot of monuments , museums and churces , like the Louvre with the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci .
It depends on five main steps , which include desigh , preparation of metal plates , printing , inspection , packaging and destruction or disposal depending on whether the fourth step is good or bad .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts .
If it 's good , they go to packing and distribution , whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well .
In conclusin , the whole process is an unreversed schedule .
It cosumemed the power which includes humans and machinic .
To begin with is design , we have to consider backgroud colour , artwork , and security issues , and then we are supposed to prepare metal plates , using skilled machinists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheets of bank notes , are printed ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) . There are some requestion -- colour on both sides , special ink , slightly raised images .

If it is a bad sheet , the porcedure is disposal -- bad sheets and bank notes should be securely destroyed .

Thionk about a family 's routine .
The Brazil and Nederlands games were a real test of our health .
And I think that it 's not technology that will change , but the people and their caracteres .
Unfortunaly , for this generation , there wo n't be real relationships , all relationships will become virtual relationships .
According to my experience , if we do n't exagerate the way we use technologie like the internet , phone , satellite .
For example , now high - heeld shoes are very trendy but they cost a lot and most women do n't look good in them .
Transportation is one of the most essential parts of our day to day life ; whether it is puplic or private , transport takes the same priority in each person 's life from the very early days .
In the age before industrialisation came into exsitance , people also used various alternatives to travel from one place to another .
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convinient .

Our town takes care of the enviremont of our neighbourhood very seriously .
Not only the supermartket has these containers . They are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion , this gives a good example of the involness of the local government .
The majority of people visiting Katowice are focused on three things : sovenirs , fashion and food .
Fortunately , visitors will find all of that in the Tourist Information Ofiice and in shops on the outskirts .
So , he is hard - working . He is a lawyer and always helps me with all my professional problemns .

In the castle there is the Holy Trinty Chapel .
The famous dishe of this restaurant is a huge hamburger .
So , train is an intermidiate way to tarvel .
I am writing to aplaay for the job in the USA published in an advertisement last Monday .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities , private cars are more attractive for most poeple .
Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient than by public transport , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
But public transport has a future for a lot of reassons . First , time . If the place you want to reach is really far , the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car . Also , the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe , there is no highway that crosses the ocean . You need an airplane and , unless you have one , you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car . A different reasson is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska , you will not need to pass through Canada . Comfort is a really important reasson , because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe . Economics is a factor too , because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do . It will be more expensive than on public transport .
In conclusion , for me , it is a lie that public transport has no future . However , they have to make improvements to this , like the use of better types of fuel or energy . One way is using renovable sources of energy , such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hydraulic(water),Also , there are biodisel and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
Dear Anne , Thank for your letter asking about my fmily and my friends .
When somedoby gets home , he wants only to relax in front of the television .
Besides this , TV companies have understood sports provide this relaxess moment , mainly for men .
In this view , I think that though there are lots of sports on Televison , there are not too many , because people have looke for it .
When the day came , we performed an amazing coreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals .
This American band is known for their lyrics that something different from other bands , something close to an emocional statement .
My techer said that public transport has no future in our society , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . Nevertheless , I disagree with her opinion because if we use public tranposrt we will pollute less .
Without travelling , people would be very bored , life would be very monotunes .
Nowdays people use cars a lot .
In the past , it was n't like that . People did not have cars . They just relied on puplic transport .
There are a few people who use puplic transport , like students and people who have a low income . In my veiw , I can say the public transport might be going to e close because nobody is going to beclose
He has been done several laws again Spanish citiziens .
I have been playing this sport since twelve years ago . This sport has taught me to respect others and not to assault them.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is that I do n't want to be weak . I would n't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule : the strong dominate the weak . When I step foot in the gym , I forget everything : shcool , home ... . Therefore , I enjoy it .
Humans are looking for power and they apply the law of the jungle , the stongest beat the weakest .

Chemical drugs can help peolple to heal and recover from diseases , but they have another hidden effect .
Therefore , The afformentioned information above shows that our future could be worse than our present .
We should live in a stabele and peaceful world .
Nowadays , people use their cars to travel for work , for holidays ...... but if the petroleo were cheaper , they could travel a lot .

There are advantages and disadvantages ; television can also cause a dipendence , cartoons and " stupid " programs can harm young people most .
Today , there are many children that have a dipendence on television , they prefer to stay at home to watch the various children 's TV programs , while once our parents preferred hanging out with their friends .
Television can be a useful strument if it is used with caution . Therefore , I recommend using it less to prevent damage to the mind .
In order to help reduce pollution , I take acction using the three " Rs " : reduce , reuse and recycle , so I am more and more eco - friendly .
I reduce the use of innecesary power at home . In other words , I turn on a light that I need while I use it ; I take cooler showers ; I heat only the neccesary rooms .
In order to reuse , I convert all things reusable , for example , a plastic bottle as a plant pot ; a glass bottle as a food container . I take my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a plastic shopping bag if a salemen offers me one .
A car is less expensive , more confortable , faster and safer .
For example , travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plane is faser .
On the other hand , it helps to reduce the polution made by cars , ..
The picture illustrate the progrocess of making notes .
Then , preparation of the metal plates and skilled machinists are needments .
If the printed sheets are good quality , they will be packed and distributed . Some partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate or packede or dispatched . The bad sheets will be disposed on . The destruction will be secure .
So it is not always a good thing , unless they are open - minded or have their own methods to punish you in a gentil way that wo n't make you regret telling them your faults or mistakes .

Now , to answer your question , I have many favourite places near my town because I live in a lovely little town , but there is one place taht is special to me : ' A Fervenza do Pedregal ' . '
It is a veri quiet place . Because of its location , in the middle of the forest , only a few people know how to get there .
It is an invledible forest , the ground is covered in low grass and there is a little river where you can swim . It is the perfect place to have a quiet day .
That is all I can tell you about this place . I hope tath my answer will help you with your project .
What is your last neame ?
I say to people that want to tay this sport that it ' s easy if you love it .

Emily knew she would have to come to a decisión soon .
The problema for Emily was that her boyfriend was as cold as the weather .
She thought he was so boring , but she did n't want to be alone . she did n't know how to live on ther own and Emily was utterly terrified of being alone .
The purpose of this report is to make people more aware of the importance of taking care of the environment in order to erradicate this problem which has serious consequences nowadays .
The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate rubbish from my town .
Combating the distriction of the enviornment , this is a serious problem throughout the world .
Nowadays , many trees and grassland areas are damaged in many countries , lots of building are constricated .
And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it .
For instance , people need too many places to build the modern society , so they cut down lots of trees , burnning many grassland areas .
Another factor is that the animals do not control themmselves and eat the plants leading to the distriction of the ecosystem .
Althought this change makes the life of people efficient , the problem should not be ignored .
It would really be helpful if the government made tighter restrictions . In today 's world , there are lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission , they are destroying the forest , farmland and wetland , discharging waste water and emitting greenhouse gas . It leads to a serious enviorment problem .
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work , as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expesnes we encounter .
The other benefit of taking public transport is fewer people are taking cars , reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environemnt .
Karate is one of the best sports I have ever enjoyed in my life . One of the reasons behind my passion for karate is that it 's a means of tamming the mind and the body .
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well . Also , it helps me to always look slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well . People who want to start doing karate have to be patient .
They should emerse themselves in daily exercise as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active . for instance , it 's adviced to eat large amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly .
My favorite sports are football , baskeball , Formula One and Tennis .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which measns burrett train , is famous and very fast .
" Blue train " , which has many beds on the train and we can sleep comfortabully on the train .
Second , travelling by train is safe and reasonable conpared to planes .
TTravelling by train is cheep and getting a chicket is easy for us in our country .
And terolism is scarce also .
A plane which was travelling from Egypt to Russia was explosed by terolist last month .
What did you do yestreday ?
I 'm nineteen years old and from this city but living in a domitory at Ton Duc Thang university .
When I am running , all the preesure I felt is gone .
We have Eather first , then people , than our house .
Eather is our home , we all have to protect it .
But now people are distroy it .
Just for mony for more houses , but if we destroy it , we will all die . Our money will be gone , our house will be gone , we will have nothing .
Besides , some people destroy farland to build houses , but if one day there is no farmland , then what should we eat ? Nothing at that time . We could n't eat anything!So what should we do ?
So my idea is that all the countries and all the people stop using farmland , forests and wetland to build houses , grow more trees , portect our world , our home star !

First , the lecturer talks about " Saran " , who proposed a challange to prove that Turing 's test was not conclusive , and that he created a paradox .
He selected people to go into a Chinese room . There was a computer in the Chinese language with diferente symbols . The Americans showed diferente behavior . They did not understand what was on the computer screen .
Science , I just remember I have always liked motor racing , but one of my frevourite is Formula 1 .
The Formula 1 seson starts in erly spring and ends in late autumn .
I try to watch every race every fournight and the training the day before the race .
Ferrari make one of the fastest cars in the world , but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac as they were in the past .
If sameone likes cars , then they should go to Formula 1 races to hear the bolid engine sound . I think that is the best sound I have ever heard in my life .
One day , the son of Lucy and her husband went to carve holes in the dirt to make a game , he made five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewelry that had belonged to generations of gods . So he started throwing that for fun . One time that he took the jewelry , it consumed the mind of the little guy and that made the jewelry emit some sounds that only giants could hear , so a mountain stood up that was the face of a giant and he perceived negative vibes , so he killed the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods .
I hope you enjoy your trip to Seoul till you left our contury .

With reference to the recent advertisement about ' USA CAMPAMENT SUMMER ' , I would like to express my interest in the position in the campament .

I started this sport when I was 10 years old . where My father was also playing this sport , but he started it when he was older than me . He was about 30 years old . where Squash is one of those games that can be played at any age . I love this game because I find it exercises the whole body at the same time . We run in a small space , moving our hands in stretched and different ways , and at the same time we work our minds , so it needs care and quik thinkink , as much any as exercise you will find down the road .
I think that anyone who wants to start a doing sport should play squach , which gives a you flexible and healthy body . At the same time , this sport can be played for a long period of time without caring about age .
I have praticed swimming for 3 years . I am a good swimmer and I have competed in different swimming tournaments .
My favorite swimmer is Michael Phelps because he was the best swimmer in the world , and I hope that he returns to the olyimpic games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 .
My favorite style is the butterfly and I always pratice this style because I want to improve .
Althouth public transport is cheap and more environmentally friendly , it is not as flexble or comfortable as the car .
Exept for in the big cities , public transport is not an easy way to get around the city . That means that in the future even more people will stop using it .
In the first step , the bank notes have to be desinged concidering some , like background color , artwork and security issues . After the design has been prepared , skilled machinists preparaation metal plates in the second step .

In today 's class , we were discussing wheather or not we agree with the often enourmous salaries of fooball players .
For me , as a passionated soccer player , it is a good point to consider .
I recommand to the clubs , be warned .
By this aciton a Ronaldo or Messie can be paid and it is possible to buy the best team for the league , like Bayern Munich is doing at the moment .
This makes football or soccer ever more equisite to a certain group of fans - hooligans .
But if the prices are too high , no onw will visit the games anymore .
First , I think that this job is perfect for me because I have travelled around the world and I know a lot of different kinds of food . In fact , on my last trip to Japan I learned to cook shushi .
One day , Michael wanted to go out , so he called his best friend and suggested going out togther . His friend agreed , so Michael put on his clothes , wnet out and closed the door , but at that moment he knew he had made a mistake .
When he got back home , it was late and the metting was canceled .
I know that I am a suitable person for this job , and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job , because I have travelled all over the world and during this experience , I have seen the necesity of work to finance my journey , so then I have dedicated myself to working on summer camps , and I have a lot of experience of this .
So , in conclusion , I think that if you contract me , you will get an axcellent person and an excellent worker .
In my opinion , public trasnport is more expensive and it is less comfortable than a car , because a car is faster than public transport .
Online Lerning
Positiv things about online lernign are that you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do n't have to carry so much paper with you . Also , you 're on your own and at your own lerning speed , which makes it more spesific to the user themself . Maybe you 're more confortable on your Smartphone than with paper .
Negaticvs about online lerning are that you 're not listening to much from a real person and more from a Computer . If pyou do n't have any listening things in the app you do n't lern how to pronounce the words . In my personal opinion , its better to lern from a teacher not only because you lern to pronounce the words correctly , but you also lern from a person , which is , in my opinion , way better . I think we spend enougth time on smartphones , so I do n't think it 's the best if we use them to lern as well .
For words , I think it 's perfect , but all the grammer and talking , I think you need a teacher .
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch , for example , sfter school .
Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building houses , which accour for some debation .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significient symbol of the development of a country ; however , on the other hand , doing large - scale building projects may bring a galaxy of probems .
In a word , the government should appeal to people in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only facus on personal profit .
It happened to me once and was very unconfortably .
Another very commom risk is falling on the court , which can cause dangerous scratches .
It is very nice that you remembe me .

Best wishes your broo Bartek !
In later times , society felt the need for change because of iniquities that were committed in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes , the building was abandoned because the government and country did n't have money for construction , to the point that the building 's metal estructure was used for weapons .
They even asked me who I wanted to go with . They grabbed my hands , wanded me to go with themself , but I had no idea , because I love my mother and my father so much .
Finally , I cried , because I could n't make a choice . My father and my mother saw me crying and decided not to keep going , and they saied sorry to each other and me .
Nowadays , I usually go back to the swimming pool at the weekens .
" So many friends learend to swim .
Then , the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists .
The next is called partially damaged shees , and bank notes are separaed into good and bad . Good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed ; the bad ones will be destroyed by fire .
This is the method of making bank notes , and the operater should pay attention to the printed sheets and how to inspect them .
The most important step is the inspectation by hand . That is to say , they should be separated into good ones , which are to be cut into bank notes and delivered to the banks , and the bad ones , which ca n't be utilised and are burnt securely in the last stage .

I dream of being a Business Administrator when I 'm older . First , I want to work for a sports company lik UA and then I may have a little variety on works .
Tennis . Tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play , but it 's a professional sport and it needs more hard training and more time to be perfect at it . First , why did I choose tennis ? Seriously , in 2003 it was my first time watching the game on TV when I saw Roger Federer play . I think he is the one that made me love this sport , due to his professional movement when playing the ball . From that time , I was interested in this game and watching all the championships , so more time , time and time it is my favoirite sport .
Aisha is in her therties .
She 's from Marocco , so she has Arabian features . For example , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , she has long dark wavy hair and big black expressive eyes .
Moreover , it is more approppiate to start constructing roads which are convenient for the majority .
First my favorite sport is futboll and I like it for many reasons . For example , while you are watching a match , you feel excited and entretaining . Besides that , football has the best fotboll player ever , which is Leo Mesy . He 's the best and he 's able to do awesome stuff when he 's playing .
The company responsible for rubbish collection collects the garbage , already separated by the families , and afterwards does the recicling .
As well as the informative sessions about the enviorenment organized by the Mayor for all of the residents , it also has lots of staff that clean the streets , take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage .
My favourit sport is football . I love it so much . When I was young , I used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona . I used to play with my friends in the street and we were so happy doing that , and after that , we played on a football pitch like in real football . I love Cristiano Ronaldo so much . He is the best player in the world . A few people have told me that Messi is the best player , but I feel angry when I hear that , because that is not true . So I am looking forward to meeting my favourite player one day . It 's like a dream for me .
last night we went to the swimming pool . It was a little bit cold , but we liked it so we went to the pool and srated swimming . I know how to swim very well , but she does n't , she has to have a support otherwise she ca n't swim .

Indeed , all the indicators show that humain behavior will not change , at least in the coming decades .
The way of livng changes every day : if we think about our grandparents ' , but also about our parents ' lives , we notice many differences .
Above all , they talked more . We live in the era of telecomunication and no one could live without their mobile phone or their computer .
Moreover , also , simple things have changed . For example , the food we eat . Some time ago , everythingh was natural , healthy ... but now everyone always eats " junk food " and thinghs like that , which are completely unhealthy !
About food , I imagine a future society in which restaurants wo n't exist . People will eat only junk food and food which has been prepared before , food in tins ... so all unhealthy thinghs , which will cause many problems .
But phobias are fears which we experience that are life - threatening and they can distrupt everyday life , but people can get over them with the right sort of therapy .
So if we want to live a life which is n't controlled by our fears , we must try to be more objective and pay mre attention to real dangers .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediatly put on her coat .
She went to her parents ' house because they sent her an email that said that her father was okay after the oparation .
tube and train , but is there a future for them or not ? I am going to answer this question by discussing disadvantanges and advantages and , finally , I will give my personal opinion .
Secondly , public transport is more ecological and less polluting for the enviromment , because it produces less polluting emissions , and many public vehicles use green energy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary now than ever before . Cities contain more automoviles and the pollution is worse .We need to change our way of thinking , and try to use public transport as an alternative to improve the enviromment of our cities .
Some buses have special and preferencial seats for old people .
Many cars poluent the planet and people are allergic to the pollution .
The train does n't cause poluition .
will be more heauthy .
I suppose their lifstile is intolerable , resteless and I really sympothise with them . The majority of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated .
They turn into arrogant and furious idols because of a lack of ptivate life and perpetual attention .
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities but , through thick and thin , they go on .They archieve the goals made exceptionally for the sake of money and vanity .
In itself , the film did n't have an special topic , but I can describe it as a friends film , as there is a lot of laughts , jokes , and it shows that friendship is the greatest thing that exists .
The public transport most used in Toluca is the bus because it is the cheapest , but it is very bad and unsafe . The qualiti of it is very bad ; the buses are old and obsolete , they have broken windows and old broken seats .
The service is very bad . The drivers are very angry and stressed out so they do not drive with cauition . In Toluca there are reports of high numbers of accidents involving buses .
I think if the goverment do the best work about the transport , they can save it .
It is true a car is more confortable , but it uses a lot of mineral recurses like petrol wich can pollute the atmosphere .
I do n't think public transport does not have a future . There are a lot of people who can not buy a car and they have to use communite transport .
The Internet is a useful tool for everyone , so we are communicating with distant friends , and we look for important information when we are studying or entretainament ourselves .
First of all , I am going to talk about the adavantages and disadvantages of this topic .
The first adavantage is that the Internet is very fast . For example , when you want information about something .
The second advantage is that the Internet by websites , such as twiter , Facebook ... You can speak with your quick friend , or you can meet ith them on the website . Therefore , you do not call them on the telephone , because the internet is very cheap .
As for disadvantanges , at present , children are aways playing with their computer games and mobile phones .
To sum up , the Internet is the most important advance in the world , but there are a lot disadavantages and advantages .
From my point of view , the Internet is useful for everyone , but we should not abuse it , and should carring out other activities .
Recently I have had a job offer from a company located in London and it requires me to have an ILETs score of 6.5 for the visa .
In particular , some people do n't have a car and some elderly people find it difficult to drive a car by themselves , so public transport helpeing them a lot .
That is why I think public transport is really important for the public and there are a lot of important things that will be possble in the future .
And maybe you will become a famous player or an ordinary player , but you will feel like a famuos one .
I think the sheep should be transferred to a place where there is specialty in animals with the same condition .
We bocome not only older , but also wiser . We learn , but the most useful thing to learn is to get a lot of experiences and , for sure , to make mistakes . But we have to be honest with ourselves and admit our mistakes to avoid them in the future .
Becsuse it is turening red !

Jonh needs to leave France next weekend , but it is not possible . I have to go and look after her because none of my family can spend three months over there .
Nowadays , technolgy is more modern than in the past and people are always developing their inventions to make them more useful .
We as humans living in these days , rely on technolgy . Every aspect of our lives is supported by technolgy .
One example is television . In the past , we used it only for watching the news and movies , but as time goes by and the technolgy develops , now television has other functions .
Second , tthese days , television has become modern and that means television can be connected with the internet .
In conclusion , televeision can entertain and also educate , because television programs do it in an interesting way .
Footbal is usually a sport that appeals primarily to males , but I 'm a girl and sometimes I realize that I know more than some males .
I have recived your letter .
I agree with the statement that Mark Twain is the greastest American writer .

I usually go to the seaside on Sunday moorning .
Firstly , they design the bank notes ' backgroud colour , its artwork and security issues .
Then the sheets of bank notes are printd . Printing colour on both sides and use sprcial ink and the images are slightly raised .
Finally , they find good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets .
At the same time , bad sheets and bank notes are securely destoryed .
The other reason for my opinión is that almost all people preffer using the eyes and ears to other people , rather than write and listen to understand new things .
That 's why I think that it 's a good momento to see things in a new way and that can be a very good opportunity .
Deffinitly , it does not always depend on the kind of programme , but I think that nowadays , a lot of televisión ofert help for people to develop more effectively .
I am communicating with you with the purpose of letting you know that we are going to set up a meeting at my office with the purpose of discussing how we could use social media to improve the communication with our suplliers . I think a great time for the meeting would be next Monday at 4:00 p.m
The purpose of this letter is to notificate you about some complaints that some citizens have . This is related to why only boys have to be in the draft for military service , and girls do not have to .
However , I just go to the restaurant on special ocassions , such as my birthday or when I pass an exam .
First of all , we should think of a design and dicide the background colour and artwork , or even security issues .
The people recycle the rubbish and they throw away the rubbish in diferents containers .
While I strugged to walk .
Finally , I saw a light appeare and I woke up .
We will have people that use the television as fun , most of the time ; but we also have other people that use television for searchs .
For example , the chanel '' Animal Planet '' has a lot of information about animals and how they live .
Nowadays , everybody has the ability to buy a television , so the numbers of TV viwers is going up ; even if you are poor or rich ; most can watch a movie , or a documentary .
Also , I think swimming can keep your body fit and it can make the swimmer cool down when it is a summy day .
I ca n't pronunciate well .
The home was on the shore . There was a tunnel and it 's hole was in the deep . At first he used to be polite and obay the other orders .
Once a day , he met a girl called Sarah . She was 9 years old . Although Michael was bigger , Sarah could control him . Every day they went to the sea to play and swim until the sun set . Once a day Sarah made a challange to Michael about who could enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out of the other hole on the shore , but Michael was afraid . He was asking himself which animals could be there or if there was air there , but he had no choice , so he accepted the challange . Sarah told him she would go first . She took a breath ... a deep one , and started to dive .
Our city is quite clean and livable ; people are more careful than before .
Generally , we use a criket ground which has an oval shape .
I tend to ride my bicycle from home to work , I have n't used my car or buses for a long time , because it is not healhty and costs a lot .
A bicycle is for me the best way we can be fit and in a good condition and also create less polution without cars .
I switch on the home hiting for a temporary period . When I am working from home , I use more energy to warmht my home .
We learn to really segreation waste and , in the future , how we could , for example , use the same glass a second time .
Anyway , a lot of people will need some transport in some cases , not privat , but public , and we ca n't say that this kind of transport willl not be useful .
As we are fully dependant on indivitual generators , these are causing multiple problems with the weather due to their smoke , oil and gas left behind , in addition to noise , of course , because they are the main source of the 18 countinous hours of noise .
People , espicially grnerator owners , have started using Canaopies , using very long pipes to get rid of as much as they can of the polution .
Other resedential areas , using their potential to maintain the environment by planting trees , roses , have nemourse green spaces .
Also , recycling the trushes is a very inteligent way to keep the town clean and get multiple uses out of the products in industry lines .
on the other hand , the eldest people in our city have many socity responsiblties and are encourging the youngest people to participate in the annual gardening festival for the indoor and outdoor gardens .
I like the Indian resturants in the city . In addition , the infrastructure and roads are well orgnaise .
In the village where I live , there is a lot of vegetation . For that reason , we try to protect the environment . One of the things we do is to do mantainance every week to the vagetation zone , checking if there is any garbage . To avoid this , we teach the younger generation enviromentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or candies on the floor . They can also help the older people . There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation . To avoid that happening again , we have a punishment that is to pay some money . If they do n't , they wo n't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they are visitors . In that case , we tell him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advice to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
Another environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of them . For that we have a care centre and , other additional institutions . We also make environmental protection centers where people can visit and learn about this . To sum up , our village is very focussed on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us .
If you want to have fun , you can go to Parque de la Costa . There are many interesting rolercoasters .
Nowdays , in school , we learn a lot of subjects which we use more or less in our lives . Some of them are really important , but some of them are just a waste of time .
When Freddy began to sing , the kids screamed and they sang with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear 's Song . Bonny played the drums and Chica served the pizza to the children , This year the stablishment closed because they found the body of a dead child .
I think it will be ghanged to become a bubile city and contin more high buildings .
If you have a car , you probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who do n't have a car , so they are used to going by bus and , for them , this way of travelling has become more conveniet , because they have done it since they were children .
She has twenty - seven maid of honor dresses . Meanwhile , she falls in love with a boy who is very handson , but he works for a magazine and he has written about weddings in the city . He is a good writer , and she unknowns that .
This story develors a mixture of themes such as courage , family values , friendship and love .
In conclusion , if you want to have a good time , you shoudl go to the cinema to see this film with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional film .
Transport polution is one of the most dangerous .
On the one hand , that quantuty of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's a personal right to have one or not .
Also , another improving measure might be encreasing green areas in cities and towns .
Factories damage nearby areas and water extremaly badly .
In my opinion , firstly , new bilding on the banks must be forbidden at all .
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way . Most people around the world can see any news live . Media is more helpful for people . Television is also used as a study resource , for example for smart classes ,
saddenly , an old carrying a heavy load hit him and fell down .
I suggest everybody should have the same evening walk . You just need a pair of comfortable shoese !
Travelling privately makes one free of issues like harrasment .
I like a lot of activities , such as travelling , readillng , playing soccer and watching movies .
Besides , public transport will reduce traffice jams .
Finally , the kind of life that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help people to have a more comfortable , easier and faster way of life , but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more . Also , things will be faster of waste to make people change their possessions more often and stimulate consumerism .
Nowadays , an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon of armland , forest and wetland disappearing because of some long - term human activities , for instance housing and transport networks are built , destroying the balance of the environment .
Firstly , it is clear that more houses and transport networks are convenient for our people . What is known to us is that the population growth is a big problem which creates a need for more palce for living in .
And builing more transport networks is also a benifit for us , for example , the high - speed rail can shorten the time spent on traveling , while the animals may not welcome it .

I practised danse a long time ago , but with age , I 've preferred to practise an easier sport .
If I could give advice to new practisers of Pilates , it would be to read a book about this method and to take time choosing a goog teacher .

One day I visited my friend Jimmy in New York city . He was a young man who was an expert on trains and tourism . He talked about how citizens and commuters move from one place to another . He told me that Grand Central Station was the largest terminus in the city . He showed me where the landmarks of the Big Apple were so sightseers could go there . He showed me the city and we went to different parts . First he took me to Columbus Circle in the south west corner of Central Park where there were the most expensive apartments . Then we went to the lake where the jogging tracks that circle the lake are popular with early - morning visitors . Then we went to the Museum of Natural History that was located near the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Then I got focal on the subway trains , so we went to Grand Central Station . When we arrived , I was amazed to see a lot of people going to work , so he told me that it was convenient for people to use the train because it is very fast and for the government it was a grat economic business . Then he told me that one of the characteristics of

I like cooking very much and I think that there are some activities that we could do in the kitcken , like baking cookies or making fresh bread .

In toward to the modernization of life and technology , people believe in different perspectives of their way of life , but the majority of ones are totally utopic .
Actually , we have a lot of problems with traffic : lots of carriages on the railway and they are n't running ; the number of cars in the street causes pollution ; crawded railways cause a late arrival .
We descovery , in this context , special diseases caused by traffic : stress , violence , pollution , lack of safety , and so on .
If public transport were of higher quality , faster and with lower fares , the majority of citizens would prefer it : it is calmer to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the journey on mass transport than in indiivdual transport ; moreover , the time spent to go and come back would be reduced , because it promotes fewer carriages on the railway .
In the morning , we went to Ocean Park , we saw dolphins , cats , horses and many other animals . In the afternoon , we went on the rollar coaster .

At the end of the day I was running out of gas , because I was too tired to walk any further .

My favourite soap opera is " Friends " . I remember watching it at home at the age of twelve and laughing out lous with my brother .
My favoutite character is Joey , who is a silly , innocent man .
One of the main advantages of family is the recogniton you are given at a specific age . Children require special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family . For instance , homeless children are more likely to fail in their education or job and not adapt to society .
Moreover , families play an essential part in protecting their members from bad atmosphere , and it probably reflects on their perfotmance toward country , leading to effictive , creative and useful civilians .

Another example of why lives are going to change completely in 50 years is because , also , that connection with other cultures makes people more concerned about their own health , their expectations of life and the way they want to live it , because every day it will be easier to see how much we are hearting the earth , so we will see faster the impacts that this has on our lives .

Nowadays , there is very little public transpotr . The general public prefer much faster and more convenient ways of traveling around . Though pulic transport is used in mager cities to avoied traffic conjustion , it is wlidly reconizge that public transport is eco - friendly .
Many people say that public transport is not confortable . That 's true . From my point of view , a bus is not so unconfortable .
Public transport is also used by children like me who want to go to school , high school or to univerity .
Finally , I think public transport has a very good future , because it has very good advantages but also some slight disadvantages . It 's also very usefull for some people .
In my opinion , public transport should n't dissapear .
I would feel more energtic throughout the day If I had some busy or tight - scheduled work .

The government are opposed to investing in public infraestructures , because the benefits are lower every year .

People should eat less fast food and do regular exercise to maintain a hgealthy lifestyle .
For example , India has a high rate of unemployment , hunger , poverty which leads to an immense embrassment about being Indian .
Nowadays , the internet represents the whole of the knowledge that people have collected over the centures .
Nowadays , public transportation is available almost all around the planet . We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave in the last century , but due to globalization and technological development , the transport sector is always in continuos transformation .
On the other hand we must mention how the plane sector has been growing . Currently it is the most common mode of transport for going away and that also means that shipping manufacture has decreaced deeply , in order to let the plane market blomm .
Talking about local transport , we have a lot of choisses like cars , motorbikes , buses , trains , but also , as we were saying , planes .
According to the information donne , the most used mode of transport is the car as most families have one , but public transportation is getting more and more common for those who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectful of the planet .
In conclusion , we are seeing a new tend in transport . Increasingly , they are faster and more developed , with the latest technology included , but in contrast , we find also a contradiction , as we found another trend for tradictional transport which avoids pollution in order to respect the Earth .
I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most public transportation . However , there are serious problems that come from it . The number of vehicles on the roads keeps increasing and causes congestion and pollution , which are far more severe than the inconvenience caused by public transportation .
Thus , I think the future of public transportation will be more proferous .

It usually saled most in Apr - Jun and Oct - Dec and slid to the bottom in Jul - Sep .
Ubearable traffic jams and no parking areas would be the main problems .

So , we can say that time is a double - edged sword , either helping you or against you , and the popular saying is right : " do n't put off the work of this day to the next day " because our work will accumulate .

It is an egyption movie starring khaled Aboelnaga and some young actors . The action of this film takes place in Alexandrie , a city in Egypt , and it is about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they do n't have much money to produce their own albums ,
that sort of band is famous among young people and they call it " underground bands " . Their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they became famous after the 25 January revoulation . I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society . There is no chance for young people and if they find it , they face a lot of problems to save it and they do n't find time for other activties , and sometimes they work on something which they never learn from or love .

They only like to wear shirts , pants , skirts , t - shirts and many more . Youngsters are influenced by watching different programmes on television .
Using private veihicles is more convenient for them than using public transport .
On the other hand , public transport does n't pollute , but the car pollutes , so , for us , travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport , but for the atmosphere , it is better to travel by public transport than to travel by car .
Also , TV , radio , the internet , big companies have adverisement about helping the planet .

It is a movie that has suspense , because you want to know how they survive . In the movie , someone loves someone and they protect each other . It is really cute , but in the 3 movies there are bad moments with the family , capitals , friends , etc .
This sport is an invidual sport , so you win alone and do n't beat a team , but if you play tournaments in pairs the one who wins is the team .
This sport is very famous all over the world , but in Italy it is n't very famous , becouse in Italy soccer is more famous than tennis .

The menú is very well constructed , and the food is based on local products .
This problem is that some aparatus are brouken and the paint is bad .

With the first problem , you should organis the timetable in order to have one class at a time .

All thanks to new technologies , innovation in the field of medicine and new scientific discoveres .
To my mind , our lives have been improved in these years by smarphone , satnav , digital TV , the Internet ..
First of all , in the next 50 years people 's lives wo n't resamble at all this .
Apart from that , I imagine the world with everything automatic , planes that take me from New York to Dubai in three hours and robots instead of weiters in a restaurant .
I can not agree with the statment that there is " no future for public transport " given that the premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
First of all , public transport is rather more convenient than a irvate car .

Secondly , other factors have an impact on the behaviour of older children like teenagers , it is not only their parents but other people , who surrond them .

Nowadays our world is fighting every day against diferrent problems . One day there is the problem of violence , one day the atmospheric conditions , or many other problems .

Or in addition , we could use the energy generated by the environment , such as the wind or inorgainc waste .

Then , when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street putting their scraps in the wrong bank , I explain to them how they have to recycle and how important it is for our environment that we carefully recycle .
This has some adventeges , such as it being more comfortable and faster .
On the other hand , private transport is damaging for the planet and we must take care of the planet . We can help to prevent the pollution of the enviroment if we take public transport , which does n't pollute .
At the moment , there is more than one car per person . That is a problem for me because people do n't take care the of envarioment .
I am plannning to visit his company .

I think that public transport is always going to be very important in our life , because not all people have the possibility to buy a car , and because public transport is less expensive than a car .

Journalilst and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance ath the value of them .
Everybody makes mistakes , but their mistakes are wtitten about and known by society , which is unfair and harmful .
They ought to apprecciate what they have and stop complaining aboout their life , because there are plenty of people , who dream of being them .

Players must be considered as a paintor working on a piece of art .
It 's not the efford they have applied or all the hopes they had .
Their expectations will be considered unuseful .
Poeple do n't stare at a painting in a museum thinking how hard the artist tried to do a good job , they will judge only it .
So , if someone is ever woundering to whether start playing this sport , they should be aware that lots of people will be expecting them to win .
There is a great number of politicians and film stars who are followed by paparazz who are trying to find out more about their private life .

I have noumerous reasons why I choose this sport as my favorite .
THE STRENGHT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS
Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers , under no cicumstances should we miss it !
I like to read too . My favorite type of book is horse books or just random books . It 's hard to explain , but I mean books with everyday action not sciene - fiction or romance .
Parkour is a discipline in which the main proporse is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B , in any kind of environment , the safest and fastest way , without causing any harm to your body .
Parkour was developed in Lisses , Frace , around the 1980 's .
One of the faundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method , created by Georges Hébert .
Basicaly , the method is based on developing the main foundations of moviment of the human body . These are : swim , run , walk , jump , quadruped moviment , climb , lift things , balance and defend yourself .
Raimond Belle was a former Vietnam souldier and worked as a fireman in the French army .
The roots of Parkour were developed by him and he taught some Parkour thechniques to the firemen who he used to work with .
His son , David Belle , was taught some of the faundations of Parkour too .
Some people say that David criated Parkour but , in fact , his father developed all the ideas of the discipline .
Parkour is n't just a physical discipline , there is also the philosofical part . Altruism , " be strong to be useful " ( it is actually a frase from the Natural Method ) , develop your body and mind so that , in a dangerous situation , you will be able to save yourself and other people , and so on .
Therefore , it is due to its philosofy and the joy that I feel before , during and after a training session , that Parkour is my favorite sport .
For me , people have become very lazy and they prefer the car rather than puiblic transport , because you can take the car when you want and go where you want whotout spending hours waiting for the bus .

Finally , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a good place for people who like history , antropology and seeing a lot of types of art .
I agree with the statement , that fmous people deserve to have a private life without jouralists following them all the time .
Sometimes it happens that journalists write some silly gosspis about famous people which is not true .
Altought it does n't mean that the press should write about your private life .
And , as a draback of being a celebrity , they are followed by papparazzi almost everywhere .
Besides , being foollowed by unknown people must be quite a scary experience .
My listening is goood and I can understand .
I look forward to hearning from you very soon . If you have any questions , you can mail or contact me .
First of all , travelling by car is more expensive than travelling by public transport ; cars have to pay for gas , insurance , repairs , environmnet fees etc ; travelling by public transport is more ecological and cheaper .

On the other hand , they are still normal peolple , who have families , partners and friends and they sometimes want to have a few private minutes , without cameras , media , newspapers , flashes and spotlights .
Wahat is more , I am sure that most of them do it on purpose because their main aim is famuos .
I 'm available every aftenoon from 5 to 8 p.m. , when it is morning in the USA .
Of course , some famous people might like this feeling that they are so liked and favourite and those who do n't like it have the posibility to protect their privacy better or more or pretend that journalists following them do n't exist .
Nowadays , people care more about themeselves and doing good things is wrong for some of them !
I am really happy you wrote to me for some advice and I am very honourated that you want to spend some time in my country .
First , you have to decide if you want to visit the north or the south part of Itlay , because if you do a full immertion tour of the intire Peninsula you will visit only half of all you have to visit .
If you like Egyptian history , you can go to Tourin , where you can find a huge and beautiful museum of Ancient Egypt .
If you want to visit the south part of Italy , you must start your trip from Florence , the bithplace of the culture . Then you must go down to Rome , the capital city of my country .
After you have seen the Coliseum , the Basilic of S.Peter and the Trevi fountain , and so on , you must visit Naples .
The idea of finding a job that lasts thre months is great .
I think you could work as an entretainer in some tourist villages roun the country .
In that way , you colud improve your way to make a relationship with people and it could also be a great help for your theatrical experience .
I know that you are a brilliant photographer and that you want to improve your hability , so I think that you could take some photos during your trip and then you could send them to some experts .

I 'm writing to reply to one of your advertisements publised in the local newspaper last week .
I 'm 31 years old , and I have had the priviledge of working as a teacher all my life , so I am an experienced person capable of taking care of children .
As well as taking part in activities relating to cookering .
At night , the noise was annoiying . I was not able to rest properly .
Also , the phone did not work properly , it was imposible to use it to call the receptionist .
In addition , the elvetor was out of order .
My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at Östermalm called : " New Peeking " . It 's an Asian buffé and they make the best food .
My favorite subject in school is probably Swedish , English or biologi .
I think that , in particular , spinning is a hard sports activity because when you have spent approximately 1 hour on your bike you 'll probably feel taired .
This could be good , allthough some people say we do n't need all this time and we have to work more .
Another point is that we can meet friends more or visit our family if we have more free time and that is allways good .
In other words , it could be said that if we had more free time , our lives would become better , because we can enjoy ourselves with friends and do thigs with our family .
Frome my point of view , having free time is perfect , because we can do more things that we are fond of and our quality of life would increase .
I study filology .
Now I am working as a jornalist at National Radio .
But instead I am writing abour stupid decorations , illnesses and other boring stuff .

I enjoyed this unforgettable trip to the meseum , and hope you can take time out to go one day !
It requires a vivid imagination to try to put a view of the future . First of all , the means of transport will change . Vehicles will depend mainly on solar energy or nuclear energy . A flying public transport bus will be a fast ride to work . You will need to supply your car with spinache after they invent a spinach - fuelled car .
I think that 's the only negatieve point about today 's television , because maybe there 's too much choice !
When we were schoolgerls , we used to spend all our free time together .
To find out about other cultures and get new knowledge completly different from school .
On the other hand , maybe if we have a break before university , the routine of working and studing every day could break .
So when univerity starts , people will become busy , the routine will not be the same , and , as a consequence , the marks will be lower .
At first , I did n't belive that this place would be as amazing as she said .
It has almost everything that you need in a cafe : comfortable chairs and sofas , beatiful features and really good - tasting coffee that they serve in most of twenty different ways and with all toppings you can think of .
Althoug the most important thing is that there were not only friendy staff but they looked like they were having tea in Wonderland , with Alice and the White Rabbit .
If TV programmes are a lot of rubbiss , it is because some people prefer them .
I had a great time with my friends , but I have a few comments concering the organisation .
However , there are a couple of small sugestions .
First of all , the vanue itself was very crowded and parking almost impossible to find .
I would like to suggest hiring special animators wgo will entertain kids .
You should think about reducing proces or offering special discounts , for example , for students .
Yours faitfully
There , you will see beaultiful cities with European architecture and you will find nice vineyards .
Chinese , Spanish and Portuguese . None of those languagues are as popular as English is .
Brazillians need to learn English because it opens doors in business and in higher education .
Learning English as a foregein language will have a huge impact on brazillians ' professional lives , helping them to get a better position .
The brazillian educational system should be aware to develop students ' language skills more .
Learning English as a second language will help brazillians to get a better job and have more opportunities in their careers .
I love outdoor activities . I have been doing rock climbing for nine years now , and started motocross in 2010 . Also , I consider myself very friendly with children and teenagers . When I was a child , my father and I used to go camping almost every other weekend . That was until four years ago , because he is no longer able to stay out of the city . But he taught me all that I need to know to suvive out there , so , I really know how to do things in the woods .
Third , public transportation sucks , when you think about it . You can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hussults of the public transportation transfers in your mind .
Secondly , Eveybody seeks safetiy in their lives .
Look around you , crimes and death are srounding us . All these people are dreaming of living a peaceful life without all the problems of killing and sadness .
For that reason , I beleive that being safe is absloutly better than being sorry . I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that life will go on and one day all of us will be satsfied with this life .
In conclusin , I think that all of us should see through rose -tinted glasses and be happy , because you live a calm life without anything making you sorry .
I will start by telling you something about Paula Echevarria . She is a very pretty and famous actress . She also writes a fashion blong . She is 34 years old and she is married to David Bustamente , who is a popular and hadmesome singer in Spain . They have a daughter - her name is Daniela - and they are like a perfect family .
Therefore , she has everything good aobut being a celebrity , but the most important is that she is a great person .
By increasing the veriety of cars with new technolgy , people 's demand hasnt ' stopped .
As technology enhances the life system in any way possible , people become more dependent and ca n't avoid it beacuse of many different attractions that these cars have .
Trafic jams will cost a lot , causing problems such as pollution , which certainly causes more health problems and will create expenses not only for us , but for others as well .
The solution is public transport again , which increases the pace of life and makes it easy to accsess by subways and special roads .
To sum up , as thought cars are too covenient to some extent , but the cost will reduce the benefits .
I am writing in response to your advertisment for the job in the USA summer camps .
This job would give me the opportunity to pactise my skills and get more experience with children as well .

The doorbell rang insistetly . It was Saturday in the early morning and I was still in bed .
What an amazing surprise ! I was very emocional and was about to cry . "
In answer to your question about the use of the internet by young people of our age , I think it is very helpful to get information more easily and quiker .
Also , it plays a freat role in removing the borders between nations . In a matter of seconds we can now communicate with people around the world , whether for important business matters or just to talk to a friend .
Obviously , we can not imagine how much time we spend online , because the whole day we are connected , in our houses , on moviel phones and on computers at work .

Let us look at an example of a univesity student .
The student had a great number of assighment and projects , so he spent more time on accessing the libabry , becoming more ambitious to study books , and using a computer to search the for latest information .
Therefore , not only did he get high scores in the reports , having absorbinge a great deal of knowledge at the libabry , but he reduced the study stress and kept healthy at the gym .
At university , I also have a lot of assighments , so I like to go to the libabry to study , where it is more quiet , spacious and internet accessible .

Twenty years ago , no one would have thought of the invention of the iPad or smarthphone and how they could change our lives , but today , these items have become necessities of our daily lives . Nowadays , many people have got into the habit of carrying their smartphones no matter where they go .

As a result , I could be very helpful with oranising sports and activities , but I could also provide assistance in other places , including the kitchen .
The crucial point is the transformations and exprerienced contradictions of the characters .
In our imperialist and capitalist world , we need more films or arthistic influences which mention the problems of our life and realities .
There are such interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would never have expected or , unsurprisingly , missinformation .
We know that making social contact can sometimes be a problem for a wide range of people , who sometimes find it a lonely and dauting experience .
However , both readers and writers do not only do it in an altruistic and philantropic way , but to get fame and popularity at the same time . Blogs and websites could give them the chance to become famous if they really appeal to a large number of people and they will also be able to earn money thanks to advertising .
To clarify what the situation is , it is true that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites , but the fact is writing or reading a blog can give people a practical way to communicate and share preferencies , beliefs or thoughts . however , more or less reliable .
Peter looked at his whach and knew that he had to do something immediately .

There you can see dinasours from prehistoric times .

In addition to having lots of information , we also can have fun seeing interesting things in the museums , such as huge dinasours . You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you visit .
Every day in my town , people talk only about football becouse it can give you a lot of emotions .
On the other hand , my advice that I would give to someone who is starting this kind of sport is that he must do it with a lot of responsability and sacrifice if he wants to become another Maradona .
In the morning , everyone goes to their job by car , but I think that the real reason for doing this is that we need to do a lot of things durind the day and with public transport we spend more time than doing the same with our own vehicle .
For example , during a foorball match , if you make a mistake it is n't too important because you have a team which can remedy it , evin if ypu do nothing .

Meanwhile , wild animals which have forests and wetlands as their habitas will lose their homes and find it difficult to survive in jungles of concrete . Endangered animals will be harder to find after the destruction of their homelands .
Also , there will be no fresh grass and grains for domestic animals , such as cows , lambs , chichen to be fed .
To reduce the above problems , it is necessary for governments to plan carefully before the construction of builings and transport and try their best to decrese the side effects .
In my opinion , there are a few advantages of shopiing .
Another good point of shopiing is the fact that it could be relaxing for some people .
Everyone considered him a crazy and boring guy obsessioned by his passion , except Kate , his only best friend , who encouraged him every time he wanted to give up his dream .
They wanted something that could be traditional and revolutional at the same time , something that could give a new vision of reality , and Kate started to offer some information about many artists .

Kate was really angry and she oredered him to leave her room immediately .
The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie star 's , but they should make their descisions transparent for most of the population though .

To curb corruption , new laws were created , instituions were re - structured and innovative mechanisms were developed to engage and give voice to the civil society .

It is really good . It is better than the previous novel , FSOGrey . I really mean it . It is not porn . BE GROWN UP PLEASE . If you do n't want to read the " sex parts " , just turn over the next page till it ends , that 's all . I did that to finish that novel . This novel is just to tell us the passionate love story between a sucessful businessman , chairmen man with a very unhappy childhood , and he only refers to his birth mother as " the crack whore " , which is related to his recent behaviour - BDSM .

They can barelly breath with all those photographers around them .
For example , when a fan follows a cab , she or he could be hurt , because the traffic is really unpredicable , or when there is a huge mass of fans , they could hurt each other .
Why is it that when men stalk women they forbid them to come closer to her , but when a papparazi hides in the car of a celebrity , he will get a huge pile of money for the photos ?
One example of this could be North Corea or some Arab countries , where their governments ban internet access for citizens . In other words , they want to mislead the people about reality to avoid the population claiming via these networks or being up in arms against their system .
So , this means we are getting less intimity and becoming more gossipy at the same time , as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites .
You can follow your favourite celebrities and have direct interaction , but this also has negative consequences such as some followers critise them .

Some people like to calculate the gain or loss from buying the lottery but other people that can afford a dolar ticket now prefer to keep their dreams .

Nowadays , people 's lives are undergoing an unexpected change all because of globalitation .
Globalitation started in the 20 's , so a huge proportion of the population has experienced this change . In my opinion , it is kind of good .
Personal contact shows a decrease in this time , because people do n't want to face their real problems . Instead , they can see all the poblems happening in the world on their smartphones .
In the future , people will comunute via their computers , cellphones , and tablets , and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life .
Of course , there will be some more electronical things like some new mobile phones with functions we could not expect right now , and there will be some other gadgets .
To put it in a nutshell , we could say that our global world will be more electronical , and there will be more gadgets , but that wo n't change our lives dramatically .
However , others companies will dominte half of the projected market share in jeans next year .
They help me to develop and to see the world from a difernt perspective .
Many people think living in the counrtyside provides a better way of life .
My town is one of the cleanest towns in my country . The authorities have arranged amny procedures to ensure that the town stays clean at the same time as being environmentally friendly .

All the previous steps and more are being applied by my town 's sitizens in order to improve the environment and go together with all the procedures that help them live a happy , healthy life .

This is the main reason why our environment is being destoryed .
My name is Pawarit Chonlahat and I have lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area has changed so rapidly , such as , now it has a lot of condomedium a long the main road and nowadays this area has a big shopping mall and a modern hospital and a large police station . That makes my life so convenient and safe because I can walk from my house to go to the shopping mall in about 10 minutes and I can walk to the hospital in just about 5 minutes , so I did n't worry when I got sick and the large police station is located in front of the hospital . That can assure safety for everyone who lives in this area .
For this reason , this is the adventages of living in this area but because of many people in this area , traffic in rush hours especially in the morning is very heavy and it takes so long to drive a car to work .That is the disadvantage of living in this area . So , in my opinion , this area should have an improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to cover this area .

The problem with this mansion is that it hides a lot of secrets and misteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners , who are a family whose husband went to war and died . So the real ocupants of the house are Nicholas , an easily scared boy , his sister Anne , who turns out to be one of the most important characters in the film , and their mother , who is called Grace and has a particulary obsession with catholisism .
The film descrives how the love that a mother can give to her children can easlily turn into an obsession . However , what makes this film so special is that it pretends to be a typical horror movie , but in its final scene , there is a sudden change wich makes it more interesting .
I would recomend this film to anyone , even those who are easily scared , because it is not like the resto of the horror movies . It is a film in which you are continuely discovering secrets as if you were another character .
So it is a cuestion that requires deeper reflexion from all of us .
Wheter public transport might be the solution , or be more suitable or not is something with arguments in its favour and against it .
You do not have to wait for a specific time to cath the bus , for example .

Though the modern cities are emerging repaidly , the problems caused by excessively exploiting the enviorment are severly various .
The red coral reef off the coast of Austrialia , for instance , serves as a shelter for algea and other tiny sea fishes and an index of enviroment fragility .
Due to the massive construction of five - star hotels on beaches , the biological chain there is cut off and enviromental variations are gone away .
On top of that , it is the regulation capacities of the enviorment for temperature , moisture and even sandstorms are eroding as less plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen into the whole system .
In a bid to address these side effects that civilization has brought about , governments must take measures stey by step to tackle them .

We have subjetive opinions ; we normally judge because we have a preconceived idea .
For example , in work interwies and jobs that have direct contact with the public , it is better to wear a formal or smart style .

Although on some occasions some clothes styles are required , people should have the freedom to choose what clothesdo they want to wear , and it should not have consequences in our lives .
In countries like Mexico , some people have the opportunity to use Uber , which is a service that you can use if you have a credit card . It is an amazing service , but not all the population have a car or the financial status to use an Uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if the bus or cab driver yells at them or drives badly . In Mexico , the public transportation , in particular the cabs , are not a very secure services , because some of the drivers steal and kindnap , in many situations they could kill you if you do not take precautions . But despite this , it is very sad that in that place people can not do some things because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more , so they have to take public transport .
Although we did not have the current social communication means such as Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp , we were very sincere and close to each other , more than these virtual frienships prevailing today .

I think there are things you need to plan because it 's important for your life , but it depens on the situation , because I also like to let things be alnd let them happend because they have to happend , so the majority of the time I prefer not to think about it and just let them happend and not to plan anything . But if it 's something related to my future or sometehin that will really afect me , I prefer to plan it , like what kind of job I want to do or about my dregree or things like that .

We take food and drinks and we spend a day in beautiful places such as the top of a montain , an amazing castle or a tipical market in a town .

Travelling by car is so much more conveniente if we think about small places such as villages or small towns .
If you consider the cahotic traffic and the long queues to get there and the impact of these factors on people 's health and people 's finances , I 'm sure you 'll change your mind about public transport .
On the other hand , it is possible to find hibrid cars , but they are more expensive than those that work with normal fuel and , for that reason , this kind of car is not people 's first choice .
Such policies will involve taxes on poluent cars , the increasing of fuel prices and the introduction of benefits for those who opt for more environmental means of transport .

Many people oday have pets of all kinds .
First of all , a pet is a friend for the family and , much better , is a memeber of the family .
One more advantage of qning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and carring .
On the other hand , there are a lot of disadvantages to owning a pet in big citiew .
Pets and animals in general need fresh air and exercize outside and not to be always in an apartment .
I have heard abou pets that get sick through living in a small apartment in town , and that is terrible .
In my opinion , it might seem good to have a pet if we teke care of it .
All in all , qing a pet in a big city must be done carefully , ensuring all that the pet needs .

The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove . The difference is that , instead of a fan , here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it needs a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the pourpose of a fan and a pump is the same : move fluid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case , you have to move air and in the second case , water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .

as much as possible of the city or town which mismanaged routine for people who travel by public transportation . As a consequence , generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I can say that there are various modes of transporotation avaliable

Alongside its development , the ablity to travalling has become easier to such an extent that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as to the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not just a citizen of his own country , but a global citizen .

No future for a public transpotr ? Is this claim true or not ?
I think that it all depands on the development .
Yes , I agree , if you planned the journey for a faraway distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it by car , because , firstly , you 'll spend less time , your journey will be comfortable , you 'll have the possibility to stop any where and for a long time , as you need to .
But if we are talking abot travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is the guestion for everyone , and there ca n't be one answer for all , because one person can use public transport , and save in this way not only money , but the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . because they spend more time travelling or they simply do n't like to travell with other people .
guide people and give them infomation , details and guidelines about pollution .
I 'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant . It 's name is " Lemon " . I go there every week . It has different food to other restaurants . I like crispy chicken with garlic sauce . It 's an excellent choice for me . And my favorite appitizer is susage and in order that dessert I like " Vadge " cake with chocolate sauce . I feel at ease when I go there . I enjoy classical music while having lunch . About the service : it 's very good and all the staff are respectable . I ca n't imagine one week without going there . That would drive me nuts . I advise everyone to go there and enjoy their time there . Also , this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really . It 's excellent . The striking thing for anyone , is that despite all of these advantages , the prices are not expensive .
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am playing with my team , I am in another world in which I can be free and happy . Apart from this , when I am feeling bad , this is a distration from university .
You should try playing , it 's such fun , but I warn you , it is not easy at first , but you hace to try many times like you should do in life .
On weekdays , I get out of my bed at 7 in the morning to go to my work , which startst at 9 AM .
In the newspaper , he read an interesting noticie .
The noticie was about a competition .
The story was very good but Michae did not know how to end the story .

Desgin the bank notes is the first and indispensable step .
Peple should decide the background colour and thw artwork and they have to consider the security issues .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged but still good sheets , people will cut them into separate notes and pack them together in order to dispacting and distribute the bank notes .
If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distoryed .
Everything began a few years ago , when Alfred , the Mayor , read an article about the importance of the surroundings to the health and happinness of people .
You probably wo n't believe me , but I met all the members of Dżem band . I talked to them and we had lunch together . They 're very nice men . Because of helping them , I had the best place during the concert and I have their authographs on the latest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
I am keen on cinema and I love to watch all types of fims .
In addition , I think that the settings are very reallistic and the actors gave a great performance .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a quialified person for the post .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after chilren from 3 to 12 yeras old . I consired myself quite patient and fun . In my opinion , they are two highly necessary qualities for this kind of job .
Although privately oned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
The flight was approximatly five hours during which I watched beautiful movies .
In New York I ate so much . I also went to the city thay never sleeps : Manhattan .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she said they do not see me frecuently and many other members of my family .
In conclusion , I had a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visited awesome places like Niagara Falls and Time Square , recieving a lot of presents and , especially , ate a lot of delicious food .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico , I would give two important pieces of advice ; first , try to get along with your travel companion and enjoy the Mexican food instead of criticising the spicy savor .
In this way , visitors will be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travel , special ocassions , etc .
What if you do n't have any of those requierments ?
Then you know hockey is the aswner .
Nevertheness , it is never enough , because dog owners are mostly to blame .
We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are clasified according to the material we want to recycle .
They occupy too many seats , inclouding priority seats .
Moreover , some old people might take this considerative action for granted and they might even command young adults or students to offer their seat without manners !
I have also worked with large and small teams in back - offices , managed many administrative activities related to mortages , personal loans , contability and investments .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this spheare .
There are a few reasons whcih show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing at the intrenational level . If you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value to your profile and you can get a higher salary .
Dear Sir or Madamme ,
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly about their experinces in life .
The reason is that people must complate their tasks in order to earn more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual thoughts .
I have worked in an Easter camp too , and I have already organised a lot of ativities , like " rappel " , paintball ...
What an unfoggetable day !
Swimming as a sport is very useful for wieght reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your wieght . It is also the best sport for asthmatic patients , because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparetion time .
Regarding advertising , technology is having a huge and not always possitive impact on outdoor advertising .
It will suit me sometimes , and it will even be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggresive .
The way it feels aggresive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
But , technology is hre for better or worse , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in the sububs of Artem or Vladivostok .
If I had this house , I would decorat it in a modern stayl .
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who , to watch this or that televison program .
Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to cook food . For these reasons , I think that the best restaurant is somowhere where they do home - made food , and a good idea for the main course is : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and , for dessert , apple cake .
They are incredibily delicious .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be indepedent .
She went there and thera was the doll with a knife in her hand . ' ' Bell , why do n't you play with me anymore ? Are you bored of me ? Just because I have only one eye ? But you removed the other one .
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentence , ' ' Why did you leave me that way ? ''

One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football , is that you have to be ready to reacive some punches .
On one hand , becoming a public figure is associated with jornalist , mass - media , flashes .
It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely toxic and they have a bad infulence on society , which assesses celebrites through the prism of journalistic documentary .
The value of their talent and abilities is measured in the amonut of tabloids scandals .
When I worked as an educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor acitivities .
The same with my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me to talk about their healht .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientits that think it helps children 's brains to develop , but it is important to supervise them , because there are a lot of violent games .
DOING EXCERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOURE HEALTH
Doing excercise is an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life . While you excercise you feel well in yourself and in your body .
Soccer is a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to controll the ball and dribble your rivals on the field .
I know that catching a celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is shocking news for people who read tabloids .
So , as you can see , I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a privte life and the ability to have a normal life should also be given to them .
Once per week on Wednesday , robbish is collected .
That is a very good idea , because that robbish undergoes recycling .
Everybody cares about cleanlinees in front of the house and in the garden .
Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity .
I am writing to apply for the post of summer camp councellor currently advertised on your website .

After finding the adoption papers , she contacted the adotpion agency .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant " .
The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings .
The last step would be to recruit a staff of prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
Undertaking a scholarship and admission to one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school in a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I acquired at high school .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the committment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my chosen university in more ways than one .
Despite these two being the most popular sports amongst atlets , many more are just as interesting and beneficial .
For example , things might not go as they had expected for multiple reasons , such as not having enoff money or not getting a job .
In addition , we had to have one year of volunteering in a Youth Supervision environment in preparation for our final assingment , so I am able to be a member of your highly - skilled staff .

I have a friendly , happy personality and find that I enjoy the chalenges of working in youth environments .
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when , acroos the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass."What 's that ? " , Max said aloud .
It 's about a teen couple who are diyng of cancer , and they have different ways of thinking about life and death .
This movie touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people usually live without apprecciate the really important things .
It is a ciclical process .
Rome had its hayday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later , it was only a shadow of its past .
One day in the future , another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse for some country to declare war on another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have their roots in much older times .
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots in events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots in a past conflict that may well have happenned already .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in the 16th century , finally rebuilt in a Renaissance style , which has remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably the famous arcaded coutyard .
During the tour , the visitors are shown several rooms and apartaments , as well as the Royal Private Apartaments with world - famous tapestries of the Polish kings ' collection .
Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't rembember is that it can also be the worst .
This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we descover something new or we say something , they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .
As I said , adolescents can be very confused and if there 's one thing that gets under our skinn , it is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite .
That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't let us fall usleep at night .
Travalling by car is also much more convenient .
In conlcusion we can say that , from the standpoint of doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people . The new boxers could be even more at risk .
There are all sorts of proposals ; lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn , or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the later rounds . These would all show off the boxers ' skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and any occurence is for some good .
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged .
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully intergrated with Europe .
In fact , in political , economic and defence terms , I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst , to a certain extent , I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
This process will continue and Europe and the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process .
In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .
These superpowers were economically , militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe .
To remedy this , the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception .
The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic on the part of the road system obviously increases the risk of drivers having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might seem an easy soloution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the railways .
People are not taking to the rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas .
Then people would be more likely to catch the train , as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for a bos or pay for an expensive taxi ride .
My soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services . This would get people off the roads and onto the trains .
To improove the rail service , trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times , i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six .
The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap , i.e. the same price as or less than it would cost to go by car .
The basic dilema facing the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .
Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport , thus decreasing major conjestion in rush hour periods .
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicular transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere , damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .
To illistrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stopped for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .
The most likely answer lies in 2 areas . Firstly , the attitude of many westerners is that it is their right to travel in such a mannor .
I am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee s and eat soya bean soup . However , I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .
Do we , the westeren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at this environmental cost ?
Just beause we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catch public transport .
That could have disasterous implications .
The 2nd reason , is the promblem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much ; there is no train to catch in the morning .
This has now been intensified with the sale of the railways to privite rail companies , profit motivated .
The vital , small rail links may now be closed , whereas priviously they where subsudised to make up the loss . Now the privite companies can not afford to do this , so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it , and the only people to do this is the government or ourselves . If we make the effort to use public transport , it will expand into a good service . Unfortunately , the public seem to be appethetic towards this idea .
Although it may sound cruel , I do not beleive that any fighter has entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks .
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' sport ' safer : having rungside doctors , banning bare hand fights , but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again at the forefront of discussion .
The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport , would be leading the protests againt boxing .
This hypocritical view is shared by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .
The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their availiable cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the lottery goes to charitable causes . The rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so - called charities .
It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely .
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high . Most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had runed their life , alenating them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .
I would also remove any American buisness interests and give the charity money to a more diserving ' charity ' .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations .
The world watched in anticipation . We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it . I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you heard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After all this time ! " , " I never thought it would happen .
Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Rumania rose against communist regimes as well . Now , three years later , communism as we once knew it no longer exists .
The repetion of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and , not only that , it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Whether it be a kitchen knife used to stab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate .
Normally , more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy .
There are people who are agains this , saying it is not natural and asking is it fair to the child to have started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .
, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles , for example .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie .
People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants . There are many complications but many are succesful .
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed , and the baby is then inserted back into the mother .
The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely benificial because married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
As the fetous begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB .
This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point about BSB .
Although British farmers have learned to diversits , dairy farming and the sale of beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy , or BSE .
For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .
This claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .
As you can imagine , this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants , where beefburgers are the main item on the menu .
The answer to this question lies in one 's feelings about Democracry .
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild , disgruntled zealots and was , therfore , detrimental to the good of society .
Like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed at was not so jaded .
However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrety ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and dificulties .
Though it has probably been around for a while , it s presence hasn't really been known untill fairly recently , and it s consequences have been devistating .
AIDS has definately had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world , because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana ; from survival kits and basement bomb shelters to an ever - circulating cheif Executive command post from the air .
It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
In part , it has created The Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th ctry is often labelled .
Presidents and dictators alike switch on the channel to recieve first - hand information from the network , such as impeachments , coups d'etat or civil wars .
40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers .
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversable .
The waters of the culunary seas had been calm and consistant for centuries .
Progress had moved slowly like the tides and the constant rythm of the waves showed little change .
However , with the dawn of the twentyth century , a storm brewed .
In an age where time is the scarcest comodity , our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .
Every morning I listen for the weather forcast and dress accordingly .
TV comercials and TV programs project models of how one should be .
People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substitued with TV . In America , this growing individualistic society , one no longer sees the realitive humanness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessfull , and attribute thier inability to achieve to a lack of effort .
There was a group of scholars in France , l'Academie Français , that set guidelines for French literature .
According to l'Academie Français , all literature of the Neoclassical period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act .
After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
He attracts the hippocracy of the Church in the old woman 's father being the Pope .
Desegragation reduced some prejudice , but it still exists .
This is based on eauity theory .
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through , we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .

The bride and groom simply go toa registryoffice andcomplete the marrige application form , which has the bride 's , the groom 's , and two witness 's sigunitures .
No picture IDs are requiered to complete the marrige applicatin form .
Becouse of the system , problems sometimes arise .
When a couple go to the city office tocomplete their marrage form , they sometimes find out that one of them ( or both of them ) is alredy married to someone else .
At that time , he was just interested in this class but had no awared of the importance .
