I wondered what I ate tonight .
Oh my god !
We found that our seats were placed in front of fireworks .
Brushing of teeth
This has been go on ever since when I was an upper grade of elementary school .
Lang is growing up and improving step by step !
I was away from my housework for about days .
The conflict is so serious .
"An apple is a round fruit with smooth and colorful skin , red , green and sometimes gold ."
He is years old and he can barely speak .
